            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am apt to fancy, that at the firſt ſight of theſe Papers, I ſhall be loaded with your ſevereſt Cenſures, condemn'd as the worſt of Hereticks, nay, and branded as the greateſt of Lyers and Slanderers. And all this, becauſe I onely tell you, what the Pope and his boldeſt Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have you to believe; becauſe I tell you what grand Authority his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath, what great power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction lyeth in your ſelves, what bloudy actions have been done to maintain theſe priviledges; and as a Preparative to all, have afforded you the Glories, Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Prerogatives of your Religion, from Brutes and Blocks, Fools, and Devils themſelves; with ſuchlike odd Arguments, as ſome of your Graver Wits have troubled themſelves, confirm'd their Religion, and pleaſured us with.</p>
            <p>But, My Maſters, I may aſſure my ſelf of a mitigation of your Fury, when you have ſeriouſly conſidered, that here I ſay nothing but what is aſſerted and vindicated by your own Authors, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by your own Authority, and agreeable to the Sentiments and Doctrine of the Pope himſelf. From whence will follow, that with what ill will or names you proſecute me for theſe Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you muſt do the ſame to his Holineſs, and the greateſt Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Religion; I being but the Compiler or Tranſcriber of their words and actions, which uſed to be your Patterns and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to live by: and now to turn tail, to oppoſe and contradict the Pope and his Learned Doctors, not to believe in his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Documents, might renew a Diſpute about your diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or that there might be two contradictory Truths; this may be true at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet the quite contrary alſo true in <hi>England;</hi> as Father <hi>Coton</hi> and other Jeſuits affirm'd at <hi>Paris.</hi> In ſhort, thus to withſtand the Pope, would ſhew your ſelves no good
<pb facs="tcp:109877:4"/> ſons of his Church, though it might good ſubjects to your King; which is a great part of a good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But by way of Apology for my ſelf, I muſt add, that your own Writers occaſioned and provoked theſe Collections; that their ſlanders ingaged me to a Vindication, and this Retort: and I think Duty and Truth obligeth me to juſtifie my Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as they theirs of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to deny us this favour, would be a Reſtraint beyond all Story: for if yours take upon them the liberty to oppoſe and defame our Church, it would be ſtrange, if you would not allow us in <hi>England</hi> to vindicate her. And by the <hi>by,</hi> it had been well, if they had not ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves in oppoſing our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and clamouring againſt the Magiſtrates for requiring it (which yet is more talk'd of then done) ſeeing theſe Papers will ſhew, both from Principles and actions, that ſome mens Doctrines are ſo dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, that the ſtricteſt Oaths are ſcarce ſtrong enough for them; and that this eſpecially is favourable enough, conſidering the occaſion of its making, and the ſeditious Principles of ſome people.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, that thoſe of ill names are half hang'd; and the poor woman that durſt not kill her Landlords ill-lucky Dog, got her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne by crying out he was Mad, whereby the Neighbours preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knockt him on the head. And thus it fares with our Religion. Of all names, nothing more odious then a <hi>Traytor;</hi> and the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> will ſcarce have any to be ſuch, but thoſe of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church; which Charge they lay ſo heavy upon us, and with ſuch often Repetitions, that moſt of their Gentry (who in this and other things are apt to be Prieſt rid) now uſe it as the onely Argument to beſpatter the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, have got ſome Proſelytes by the ſtrength of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
            <p>But I would have them to remember once for all, that every one in <hi>England</hi> is not of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> [and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, at this time, I ſhall not concern my ſelf] and for ought that I know, our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> are as great enemies to our Church as the <hi>Romaniſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain I am, the Papiſts ought to be cautious in their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt theſe miſchievous <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> alſo, leſt at the ſame time they do but condemn themſelves: and I <note n="a" place="margin">—Utinam eorum non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli qui rectiſſime damnant, non peſſimè imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarentur, Bp. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> de jurament. Prael. 7. § 3.</note> wiſh there were no reaſon for ſuch a ſuppoſition; yet it is too true, that at the ſame time that the former were Rebels againſt the King in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> was as active in <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſpiſing and vilifying his Majeſty through his Viceroy (then Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond)</hi> as much as thoſe did the King in <hi>England.</hi> And though here the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> impriſon'd the King, renounced him by their <hi>Non-Addreſs,</hi> and by their other villanies ſet up the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and the <hi>Independants,</hi> and other Phanaticks ſtruck off the Head: yet will the <hi>Iriſh-Romaniſts</hi> gain ſmall honour by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſeeing they did as much as lay in their power to act the ſame to their Viceroy, by fighting againſt him, excommunicating him, combining to take away his life, or to deliver him up to the <hi>Independant</hi> Army; by trayterouſly offering themſelves and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the command of Forreigners, as <hi>Lorraine,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> nay the Pope himſelf. Not to inſiſt here how grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the Kings Murther was to ſeveral <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and how
<pb facs="tcp:109877:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> formerly they have gloryed in the Murther of other Princes.</p>
            <p>Yet will their Writers take the confidence to declare their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie and loyalty to the face of the whole world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely ſeem to quit and clear themſelves, but at the ſame time beſpatter and aſperſe, what in them lyeth, us wicked Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as they are apt to call us.</p>

            <p>Towards the latter end of the ſaid King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> was ſent a wooing into <hi>Spain;</hi> at which time, the <hi>Romanists</hi> were fill'd with hopes (though upon no certain grounds) of the Converſion of the Prince, a Free Toleration of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather that the whole Kingdom would be at their Devotion. As a preparative to this grand Expectation, Father <hi>Pateſon</hi> drew up a Book under the Title of <hi>Jeruſalem and Babel,</hi> or <hi>The Image
<pb facs="tcp:109877:5"/> of both Churches</hi> (collected moſtly out of the Anſwers to <hi>Anti-coton</hi> and <hi>Brerely.)</hi> This Treatiſe he dedicateth to the Prince; the main deſigne being to vindicate the Popiſh Loyalty, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Proteſtants to be abſolute Rebels.

            <p>But, Gentlemen, to take off theſe ſlanders from my Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> (the freeſt from eſtabliſh'd blemiſhes of any in the World) and as we ſay, to ſet the Saddle upon the right Horſe, was this Treatiſe by way of a retort undertaken. And for my ſo doing, I need no other Apology, then the words of your own <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Proteſtants Apol.</hi> Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, § 7.</note> Mr. <hi>John Brerely,</hi> or as ſome think <hi>Anderton;</hi> thus.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Being therefore thus provoked, or rather urged, it will not, I hope, ſeem offenſive to the Diſcreet and Sober</hi> [Romaniſt] <hi>againſt whoſe confeſs'd loyalty I hereby intend nothing, if I but a little examine, not what I can, or am provoked to object, but what is by our Learned Adverſaries themſelves confeſs'd and reported on the contrary part. Wherein (courteous Reader) if much contrary to my diſpoſition and thy liking, I do ſomewhat enlarge my ſelf in more fully opening thoſe things,—I am not without all hope of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, eſpecially conſidering that the foreſaid Occaſion, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth me (ſo unwilling thereof) is in it ſelf ſo provoking, uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and exceeding.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109877:8"/>
            <p>But here it may be objected by ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that in the following Aſſertions, and Hiſtories of King-depoſing, I do but belye and ſlander them, falſifie and corrupt mine Authors, and ſo cheat and abuſe my Readers: For the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) never taught diſobedience to Magiſtrates, never allowed Kings to be depoſed; nor could the Pope and Cardinals (the true <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar. de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriis</hi> de Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuris Eccleſ. <hi>Tom 1. lib. 5. diſp. 14. cap. 1. pag.</hi> 655.</note> Repreſentives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) being infallible, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch ſolemn things as <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Breves,</hi> publiſh ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Doctrines.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this Charge, I hope I ſhall return enough to clear my ſelf, by affirming, firſt, that the Doctrine or words are none of mine, but their own, as appeareth by the Quotations of their Authors. Secondly, If in the multitude of theſe Citations, I have by haſte or chance (not by deſigne) miſtaken ſome, it no way contradicts the Doctrine it ſelf, which is held ſo Univerſally by them, as will appear preſently hereafter, by the Teſtimonies and Confeſſions of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves. Thirdly, That herein I do not intend all, that pretend to be the ſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; there being both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> many Noble and worthy Perſons of that Perſwaſion, who do deteſt and abhor this King-depoſing Principle. But whether in ſo doing the Pope doth look upon them as true ſons to him and his Church, I ſhall leave to the determination of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves: And if in this there be any doubt or diſpute, we may ſuppoſe the Pope, Cardinals, and their chiefeſt Doctors about them, may beſt underſtand the meaning of their <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and ſo more capable to decide the Queſtion; which is one reaſon that I all along uſe the word <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as thoſe adhering to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> or that which is taught there by the Pope as true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Fourthly, For the better Confirmation of this Aſſertion, I have ſhew'd and proved theſe Treaſonable Poſitions from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hundred of their own approved Authors. But if this number be not ſufficient, <note n="b" place="margin">Sexcentae doctorum &amp; Pontificum My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </note> 
               <hi>Perron, &amp;c.</hi> rather ſay that theſe, with your other chiefeſt Doctors, Divines, School-men, Canoniſts, Lawyers, with your grat eſt Scholars and Writers, have belyed and ſlander'd you and your Religion; rather then I, who am onely the Inſtrument to convey to you the Words, ſentiments and belief of theſe your grave Oracles; leaving at your own diſcretion, either to approve or reject them.</p>
            <p>For if you doubt or queſtion the truth of this Aſſertion,—<hi>According to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>Kings may juſtly and lawfully
<pb facs="tcp:109877:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> be depoſed</hi>—[it being nothing to the purpoſe, which way, or by what knaviſh diſtinction]. The true-blew <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſure you, that it is a truth ſo certain, that not ſo much as <hi>any one do make any doubt of it. For,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,—It is agreed on by all:—Nor amongſt the School-men is there any Controverſie about it, nor can they ſhew one Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor againſt it.</hi> And to ſay that Kings may be depoſed, <hi>is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſentence;</hi> and this is not a <hi>meer Opinion, but a certain truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Catholicks.</hi> And that this may be <hi>juſtly done, none but a Madman will deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decianus</hi> ſaith that it is <hi>the true and common Opinion;</hi> ſo that <hi>Germonius</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>it is madneſs not to believe it: It is now evident and conſpicuous to all,</hi> ſays <hi>Mancinus</hi> and <hi>Capiſtranus. Botero</hi> would have us believe that it is <hi>ridiculous to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</hi> or as <hi>Gretſer</hi> ſaith, to deny this King-depoſing Doctrine, as the ſame to <hi>deny the Catholick faith:</hi> And this he repeats over and over again, that he might be the better believed; and offers at ſome reaſon for it too: which he need not have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf with to have convinced King <hi>James,</hi> ſeeing his Majeſtie would eaſily believe him, if by the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> he meant the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, as we need not queſtion but that he did.</p>
            <p>In behalf and vindication of Allegiance in King <hi>James</hi> his time, was here publiſh'd by Authority a little Book call'd <hi>God and the King.</hi> In oppoſition to this Tract, is another Dialogue printed by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> beyond Seas, and alſo call'd <hi>Deus &amp; Rex;</hi> wherein is affirm'd that this King-depoſing Doctrine is <hi>doubtleſs the ſuffrage of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregorius Nunnius Coronel</hi> telleth us, that if we ſhould <hi>read all the Ancient and Modern Divines and Lawyers,</hi> we ſhall finde <hi>that they do unanimouſly affirm this Doctrine;</hi> and thoſe who think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>are not onely far from truth, but madmen.</hi> If you ask Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> of this thing, he will tell you, that it was <hi>always the judgement of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, that all Magiſtrates and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines maintain'd the ſame; and to believe the contrary, would make them</hi> Schiſmaticks <hi>and</hi> Hereticks, <hi>or elſe the Church muſt have</hi> fail'd, <hi>and ſo the</hi> Pope <hi>not to have been Chriſts</hi> Vicar, <hi>but a perfect</hi> Heretick <hi>and</hi> Antichriſt. If you adviſe with <hi>Adolphus Schulckenius</hi> Vicar-General of <hi>Colen,</hi> he will plainly tell you, that it is the <hi>judgement of all their Divines, Lawyers, Councils, and Popes:</hi> that he <hi>is no good Catholick that denyeth it,</hi> which cannot be oppoſed <hi>without great raſhneſs and blaſphemy:</hi> and no leſs man then Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> aſſureth the Catholicks, that by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this Principle, <hi>they are no Traytors, nor hold Aſſertions Treaſonable, falſe or undutiful.</hi> His friend Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſaith that it is <hi>aſſerted and taught in all the Schools, both of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and their Lawyers; and that the Doctrine is certain, and muſt be believed as an Article.</hi> And again, that it <hi>is the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain undoubted Common Judgement of all the learned Catholicks.</hi> And in another of his Books, thus he aſſures his good <hi>Romaniſts:—All Catholick Subjects alſo of other Countries do hold and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Doctrine be not true, <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> will have the <hi>Church to erre;</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> affirms that <hi>it is as certain, as it is certain that the Church cannot erre:</hi> That to believe otherwiſe, is <hi>againſt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical

            </p>
            <p>No leſs man then <hi>Leonardus Leſſius</hi> (though under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of <hi>Singletonus)</hi> tells us, that to think that Kings may not be depos'd, is expreſly againſt the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Council: whence he makes theſe following Concluſions; and the ſame method and arguments are alſo uſed and approved of by Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>

            <p>
               <label>II.</label> If this King-depoſing Doctrine be not true, then muſt the Popes themſelves alſo be <hi>fallible;</hi> for then muſt <hi>Gregory</hi> VII have <hi>erred, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> II have erred, and ſo muſt alſo <hi>Gregory</hi> IX.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label> If this Principle be not true, then muſt alſo the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf have <hi>erred</hi> for many Ages; nay farther, to have <hi>erred</hi> willingly or maliciouſly, with a deſigne or on purpoſe: And that Hell hath prevail'd againſt the Church; and ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Church not to be a true Church, nor the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label> And if the Church, Councils, Popes, have <hi>erred</hi> in this, they may alſo erre in other Articles, as the Sacraments, Trinity, Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that with greater eaſe and facility; whereby Chriſt muſt be a Deceiver; and ſo we may <hi>ſuſpect the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the judgement of their ſo much cryed up holy <hi>Leſſius,</hi> who farther aſſures us, that to deny this Doctrine, is the meer <hi>cunning and inſtigation of the Devil.</hi> Again, <hi>That there is ſcarce any Article in the Chriſtian Religion, the denying of which is more dangerous to the Church, then this Doctrine.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>That it is more pernicious and intolerable, then to erre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacraments.</hi> And to conclude with him, he at laſt conjures all that call themſelves Catholicks, upon their Salvation, to have a care how they deny this.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>Coquaeus</hi> will tell you, this King-depoſing Doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the holy Scriptures, and the Rules of Chriſt. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:109877:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> aſſures us, that to doubt of the truth of it, would ſeem not onely to <hi>oppugn the verity of the Chriſtian Faith, but to ſavour of perfect Heatheniſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to trouble my ſelf or Reader with their zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in defence of this King-depoſing Doctrine (in which I might be endleſs) I ſhall tell you, that no leſs man then our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Allen</hi> declares his judgement in theſe very words—<hi>God had not ſufficiently provided for our Salvation, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church and Holy Laws, if there were no way to deprive or restrain Apoſtata Princes.</hi> The foreſaid <hi>Coquaeus</hi> ſaith, that otherwiſe <hi>Chriſt had not ſufficiently provided for the ſafety, either of the Common-wealth, or of our Souls.</hi> And <hi>Petrus Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trandus</hi> poſitively declareth for the former Principle, that if ſuch a depoſing Authority had not been, that <hi>then Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had not ſhewn himſelf wiſe or diſcreet;</hi> or, as Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gods providence had been defectuous.</hi> And when <hi>Johannes Mariana,</hi> the ſo noted <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuit, had in one of his Books ſo expreſly maintain'd the lawfulneſs of <hi>killing</hi> bad Kings, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the ſaid Book was cenſured; I meet with an <hi>Engliſh Romaniſt,</hi> thus to vindicate or juſtifie the ſaid Book—<hi>They are enemies to that holy Name</hi> [i. e. of Jeſus] <hi>that condemn'd</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana <hi>for any ſuch Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſo zealous are ſome for this King-depoſing Doctrine, that with <note n="a" place="margin">De Politia &amp; Immunitat. Eccleſ. <hi>part 4. cap.</hi> 50.</note> 
               <hi>Laurentius Ortiz de Iberrola,</hi> they will aſſure it the onely ſafety and preſervation for Princes. But King <hi>James,</hi> who thought himſelf not a little concern'd; and therefore thus deliver'd his opinion to his Parliament:—<note n="b" place="margin">Speech in Parliament 1605. <hi>Vid.</hi> his works, <hi>pag.</hi> 504.</note> 
               <hi>As on the one part many honest men ſeduced with ſome errors of</hi> Popery, <hi>may yet remain good and faithful Subjects: ſo on the other part, none of thoſe that truely know and believe the whole grounds and School-concluſions of their Doctrines, can either prove good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or good Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, if for all theſe grand Teſtimonies, they ſhould plead their Allegiance, and their reſpect to Princes; I could ask why all Books writ againſt this King-depoſing Doctrine, are cenſured and prohibited by their <hi>Indices Expurgatorii;</hi> whilſt on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thoſe who affirm it, are publiſh'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with honour, as true and authentick: and if <hi>Agapetus</hi> above a thouſand years ago, ſpeak honourably of the Imperial Authority, the <note n="c" place="margin">V. Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Patrum.</note> 
               <hi>Expurgatorian</hi> Index muſt ſtifle it with ſome worſhipful gloſs or other. And if any ſhould deny this to be the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I ſhould gladly know, where is the judge? whether the Popes themſelves, the Cardinals, their greateſt and moſt famous Writers, as <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius', Perron, &amp;c.</hi> do not underſtand what are the Tenents, and the meaning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as well as ſome private <hi>Engliſhman</hi> here; and whether we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Popes Cardinals, and their learned Doctors, before the ſaid private perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus are the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as ſtout and zealous for this King-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Doctrine, as the <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mart. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> de bello Tartar. <hi>pag.</hi> 45, 107, 121, 157.</note> 
               <hi>Chineſes</hi> were for their Beards; and do adore and worſhip this deſtructive Tenet, as the old <hi>Cainites</hi> did <hi>Cain,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt man-killer; or the <hi>Ophitae,</hi> who worſhipt the Serpent, becauſe he was the firſt deceiver, and, as they ſay, the Author of good and evil.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> may perceive what danger he runneth
<pb facs="tcp:109877:10"/> himſelf into, if he dare but offer to oppoſe this Treaſonable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſeeing to deny it is madneſs, flat Hereſie; nay Paganiſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgements of Popes, Councils, and the whole Church, nay, the Goſpel of Chriſt; a more intolerable Hereſie then to <hi>erre</hi> concerning ſome of the Sacraments; nay, ſo groſs an one, that it doth deſtroy the very Church and Goſpel it ſelf: wherefore they perſwade us, that all good and ſound Catholicks muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Kings may be depoſed, ſeeing all who are truely <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> and Sons of that Church, do and muſt believe ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe men are like <hi>Polychronius,</hi> who would rather erre with <hi>Macarius,</hi> then be in the right with others; and this Doctrine muſt be the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from other Chriſtians.

               <hi>Tetzelius</hi> was ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> with multitude of Pardons to advance money for the Pope (which were then firſt oppoſed by <hi>Luther).</hi> 'Tis ſaid that this <hi>Tetzelius</hi> affirm'd that he could alſo pardon ſins to come; whereupon a <hi>German</hi> Gentleman bought ſuch an one of him, and afterwards rob'd the <hi>Dominican</hi> Pardoner: <hi>Tetzelius</hi> threatning him, the Gentleman pleads he had bought his Pardon for it, declaring that was the ſin he determin'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: to which <hi>Tetzelius</hi> could not reply.</p>

            <p>If thus Religion it ſelf will vary and alter in time, there needs not be ſuch a confidence placed in their Infallibility: and yet 'tis pretty to obſerve, that this their grand Rule, which on all occaſions they call to their aſſiſtance, they do not know where to fix or finde; and that which muſt judge the reſt, is of it ſelf unſetled and uncertain. And they grant that a Church that is <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. W.</hi> Schiſm. diſarmed, <hi>pag.</hi> 22, 26, 28.</note> fallible may lawfully be forſaken. But this by the by, and I ſhall confeſs nothing to the purpoſe, as being beſides my deſigne, and ſo the leſs careful in its haſty ſcribling.</p>
            <p>As for this King-depoſing Doctrine, though it be poſitively taught and believed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by Pope, Cardinals, their greateſt Doctors, and every where by thoſe whom his Holineſs looks upon as through-paced ſons to him and his Church; and thoſe who abſolutely deny this Article (as <hi>Widdrington, Caron, Barckley,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109877:17"/> &amp;c.) are with their books cenſured and prohibited, as rotten, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and falſe ware: yet in Countries far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> when this point cometh to a pinch and a ſerious debate, then we ſhall ſee ſome of them, like <hi>Coton,</hi> and the other <hi>French</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, to have two Conſciences, one at <hi>Rome,</hi> and another at home.</p>
            <p>As when any miſchief is done, the Childe cryeth Nobody did it, thereby thinking to ſecure it ſelf: ſo now, when ſome Kings and Princes have look'd upon this King-depoſing Doctrine as wicked and dangerous; we have ſome of the ſecular Prieſts, and ſome <hi>French</hi> of a freer humour, will throw all the fault upon the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> and would gladly make the world believe that all other <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are innocent as to theſe accuſations, being true Subjects to their Prince, and Enemies to Treaſon or Sedition; and that the contrary Principles are onely taught by the Jeſuits: to which Order, many other Catholicks having no good will, make it their buſineſs to expoſe them, as much as they can; and this Quarrel is now grown to ſuch an height, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no ſignes of a Reconciliation; which every day weakens the Papal Authority, and may in time ſqueez that juriſdiction within its own narrow limits.</p>
            <p>The truth is, ſome other Orders think the Jeſuits carry too high an hand, and others ſuppoſe them too buſie and active in State-affairs, and have been the Fomenters of many troubles and Wars in <hi>Europe;</hi> to which purpoſe I meet with this biting Character.</p>

            <p>But now ſome Princes begin to ſee their own Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, are ſenſible how unworthy their Predeceſſors have been abuſed, and begin to underſtand that their Power is Independent; neither receiving their Rights from <hi>Rome,</hi> or her Popes, but that their Crowns were given them from Heaven; and that rather, the Popes have been like that Bird in the Fable, and made uſe of of old by the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryar <hi>Jehan de Rochetaillade</hi> [by ſome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jehan Froiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard.</hi> Chron. Tom. 2. fol. 182, 183.

And the truth is, the Popes have done with the Empire, as the <hi>Snake</hi> in the Fable did with the Husbandman, who finding it almoſt frozen to death, in pitty brought it to the fire-ſide, where by the warmth having recover'd ſtrength and vigor, all the thanks it return'd was the ſtinging of the Goodmans Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>And for theſe ungrateful actions, many have undertaken to foretel ſtrange Judgements and Calamities to happen upon the Popes. But though for mine own part, I am no great admirer of our later Prophets, and trouble my ſelf with their odd Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions no farther then for recreation; yet ſeeing the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have put ſuch a ſtrange confidence in thoſe <hi>Relations</hi> of their Swediſh St. <hi>Brigit</hi> [or <hi>Birgit]</hi> as to declare that they were all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired by God himſelf; and not onely canoniz'd the <hi>Lady,</hi> but by ſeveral <hi>Bulls</hi> and Authorities ſo confirm'd the truth of her Book, that it muſt not be contradicted: yet if they will but ſeriouſly look into her <hi>Revelations,</hi> they will finde little reaſon to boaſt ſo much of them, ſeeing they will finde few ſo <note place="margin">Revelat.

And ſuch another Tale they tell us of a <hi>German</hi> Woman call'd <hi>Jutta,</hi> whoſe young Childe being ſnatch'd away by a Wolf, and carryed into the Woods; of this the Mother informed, runs to the Chappel, and took the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Chriſts Fore-ſkin, the people of <hi>Akin</hi> ſay they have it; thoſe of <hi>Antwerp</hi> affirm they have it; <hi>Heldeſham</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> brags of it; the <hi>Romans</hi> ſay, 'tis in St. <hi>John Laterans</hi> Church. And again, both <hi>Byzanſon</hi> and <hi>Charroux</hi> in <hi>France</hi> boaſt that 'tis there. And yet others ſay that it is at <hi>Calcata</hi> twenty miles from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, what a Monſter will they make of St. <hi>John Baptiſt!</hi> thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſuring us that his whole head is in the Cloiſter of St. <hi>Sylveſter;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Malta</hi> ſay, they have the hinder part of it; <hi>Amiens</hi> and St. <hi>John Angelique</hi> brag of the fore-part. And although <note n="a" place="margin">Hiſt. l. 3. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Theodoret</hi> declareth that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate burned to Aſhes the body of this St. <hi>John,</hi> yet they will have the <hi>Finger</hi> wherewith he pointed, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> was ſaved; but if you have a minde to ſee it, you muſt trudge to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to <hi>Bourges,</hi> to <hi>Bezanſon,</hi> to <hi>Fortuits,</hi> to <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Florence;</hi> every one of theſe places affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have it.</p>
                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Andrew</hi> hath two Bodies, one at <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> another at <hi>Melple.</hi> And St. <hi>Anthony</hi> hath two, one at <hi>Arles,</hi> another at <hi>Vienna.</hi> St. <hi>Matthias</hi> hath three Bodies, one at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>Padoa,</hi> and a third at <hi>Triers.</hi> So hath <hi>Lazarus,</hi> at <hi>Authun,</hi> at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and at <hi>Avalon.</hi> And St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> hath four Bodies, one nigh unto <hi>Narbonne,</hi> a ſecond at <hi>Rome,</hi> a third at <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and the fourth at <hi>Piligni</hi> near unto <hi>Nantes.</hi> To St. <hi>Anne</hi> they give five Heads, <hi>Lyons, Apt</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> St. <hi>Annes</hi> in <hi>Turingue, Duran</hi> in <hi>Juliars,</hi> and fifthly, <hi>Tryers;</hi> all theſe places boaſt of ſuch a Skull. And for St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> for ought that I know, the preſent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> give him as many Arms, as the old <hi>Romans</hi> wounded them with <hi>Arrows,</hi> for they allow him no leſs than twelve, <hi>viz.</hi> one Arm at <hi>Mombriſon</hi> in <hi>Foreſt,</hi> one at St. <hi>Servins de Toloſe,</hi> one at <hi>Caſe-Dieu</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and one at <hi>Angers;</hi> beſides theſe, two at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> two at <hi>Piligni,</hi> two nigh unto <hi>Narbonne,</hi> where he was born; and laſtly, two in St. <hi>Laurences</hi> Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> And many ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like monſtrous inſtances might be ſhewn, enough to cool my Zeal and Fancy, though apt ſuperſtitiouſly to admire Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>What might I ſay of the Milk of the Bleſſed Virgin, now ſo plentifully brag'd of in many places, that the famous <note n="b" place="margin">Colloq. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinat. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis ergo, pag. 260.</note>

And for the Croſs, there is ſcarce a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> in the world but brags that he hath a piece of it; which made the former ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſon declare, that if the pieces of the Croſs now brag'd of and ſhew'd about, were gathered together, they would fill or load a great Ship; as St. <note n="c" place="margin">

Again, how a wicked Monk dying without Confeſſion, <note n="h" place="margin">Id. p. 381.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> went and beg'd of Chriſt his ſoul; but being denyed, he goeth to the Bleſſed Virgin, and deſires her to intercede: ſhe attended with her Maids, haſtes to Chriſt, who conſented that the ſoul ſhould be reſtored to the body to repent. This grant ſhe informs <hi>Peter</hi> of, who thereupon, falls upon the Devils, and bangs them away with a great Key he had, takes the ſoul from them, giveth it to two Angels to carry it to its body; and thus the Monk revived.

To this they reply, that there was one wicked ſin which he never confeſs'd. This puts her to her Trumps how to bring him off clear; at laſt finding no other way, ſhe gets his ſoul reſtored to his body; then he went and confeſt that ſin to a Prieſt, and ſo dyed, and never fear but he ſlipt into Heaven.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109877:36"/> he undertook to make them good friends: upon this he calls the Beaſt to <note place="margin">L' Alc. des Cord. lib. 1. pag. 188, 189.</note> him, ſaying, <hi>Brother Wolf, you ſhall promiſe to live quietly, if the people will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you Victuals.</hi> Then the Wolf bow'd down his head in ſign of conſent: But <hi>Francis</hi> bid him plight his <note n="a" place="margin">Da mihi fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> troth: Then the Wolf lift up his right paw, and <hi>Francis</hi> held forth his fiſt, and ſo the Saint and Beaſt ſhook hand and foot. Then <hi>Francis</hi> Preach'd; and after Sermon, paſt his word to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens for the Wolfs future good behaviour, provided they would not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Wolf: to which they promiſing, and the Wolf kneeling down in ſign of agreement, all the people ſhouted for joy of the Peace: And thus the Wolf lived two years, begging his meat from door to door; the very Dogs all the while not ſo much as barking at him.</p>
                  <p>Nay, theſe Animals are doughty Champions for Invocation of Saints too. Thus they aſſure us, that a little Bird, being <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gononus,</hi> pag. 150.</note> ſeiz'd on by a greater, cryed but out <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and preſently the great ravenous Bird fell down dead: That a Parrat ſporting her ſelf out of a Cage, and being almoſt ſeiz'd upon by an Hawk, did but call upon St. <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> and the Hawk fell down dead, and ſo the Parrat eſcaped a ſcouring. Nay, that a Faulkoner being to be hang'd for looſing his Lords Hawk, and had the Rope about his neck, did but think upon our Lady of <hi>Hall</hi> [a place in <hi>Hainault,</hi> where of late her Image is ſet up and more peculiarly worſhip'd] <note place="margin">

And how another time, he thinking to make ſure of her, put out his ugly long tongue, and ſwallowed her up: ſhe being in this pickle, made but one ſign of the Croſs, and the Fiend burſt in two, and ſo ſhe eſcaped that ſcouring.

                  <p>But to go a little higher, you ſhall ſee what an excellent Heaven they will afford to the ſons of their Church; though certainly, when ſome of them thus think to ſet out its glory and honour, they rather make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to very Chriſtians, I am certain an Argument of Deriſion to the Atheiſt.</p>
                  <p>As when their <hi>Barelete</hi> can confidently tell the world, what a great deal <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>H.

                  <p>Like to this is another ſtory, how after Chriſts Reſurrection, ſeveral <note place="margin">Id. pag. 304.</note> ſtriv'd to carry word of it to the Virgin <hi>Mary.

And though the good Thief beg'd the imployment, yet Chriſt told him he was not fit, becauſe his leggs were broak: And ſo at laſt they were forced to ſend an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
                  <p>And as bad as the former is this, that ſome days after <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Id. pag. 301.</note> the Apoſtles went and complain'd to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he had not ſent the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to them as he had promiſed: Upon this <hi>Jeſus</hi> went to God, telling him what he had promiſed, and that it was now time to perform it.

Upon this the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſires to know how the people had uſed him: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhews him how they had crucified him: then the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> cryed out, <note n="b" place="margin">Heu mihi!</note> 
                     <hi>Alas, wo is me,</hi> and ſo turned himſelf into another ſhape, that they might not ſeize on him.

                  <p>But leaving theſe Blaſphemies, they will tell you how to get into this Heaven; for I ſuppoſe every Order hath the ſame benefit with the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans;</hi> and how they do, take this one Example.

                  <p>Thus have we ſeen the thumping commendations of their Saints, Devils, nay, of Heaven it ſelf; in which, they have rack'd their Wits ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tenter-hooks to make all theſe their glories lovely and taking, that by thinking to over-do, they have come ſhort; and inſtead of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them amiable, have ſhew'd them but as contemptible: As if all their pains and labour were guided with the ſame misfortune of our <hi>Arcadian Demetas,</hi> who after all his pumpings and endeavours to make his Madam <hi>Mopſie</hi> renowned and famous, ſum'd up all in this, that ſhe was his <hi>own Pigs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,</hi> whereby ſhe became more ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>I have been the longer upon theſe Wonders and Fopperies (and might eaſily have enlarged their number to a great Volume) becauſe I finde them in every place ſo triumph over all other people by their Miracles, which in every Age they make ſo neceſſary a Mark of a True Church, that they think it none of the leaſt Arguments againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>But theſe may give you an hint, what little credit may juſtly be given to ſuch Tales: and when men have trapt any as Impoſtures, ſo oft in lying and cheating, they have ſmall reaſon to believe them in their other Stories or Actions. And beſides theſe Forgeries, when we conſider what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact jugling and deluſions there may be, and that the Devil alſo may have a hand in the imployment, as alſo ſome may have their Natural cauſes; we ſhould not ſo eaſily believe all to be gold that gliſtereth, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing we ſee or hear, to be a Miracle wrought by God, ſince <note n="b" place="margin">2 Theſſal. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nor did the Pope finde any fault in this Salutation, but onely that he thought them to be Hypocrites, and to have ſpoke him fair, when he thought they perfectly hated him.</p>

                  <p>Much about the ſame time with the former, lived another famous Cardinal <hi>Henricus de Seguſio,</hi> but now better known by the name of <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> who is as reſolute as any for the <note n="b" place="margin">Domini Temporales non ſolum propter ſuam Haereſim, ſed etiam aliorum, quos dum poſſunt, admoniti, extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare negligunt, Excommunicari poſſunt, &amp; Terrae ipſorum exponi Catholicis occupandae—idem ſi Princeps neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligens inveniatur circa Regni Regimen &amp; juſtitiam ſacien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. <hi>Hoſtienſ</hi> Summa, lib. 5.

                  <p>This ſtartles the Clergy, who with the <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> preſently ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the third Eſtate (ſomewhat like our Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)</hi> with a reſolution to expunge this honeſt and loyal Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet declared their continuable obedience to their King: And as a main Engine to carry this their deſign about, they deſired <hi>Jaque Davie,</hi> the famous Cardinal of <hi>Perron,</hi> to endeavour to work over to them the third Eſtate, knowing that his voluble Tongue, uſed to be carryed on with ſo much Learning, Judgement and Sweetneſs, that it ſeldom miſt of that it ſpoke for. Accordingly attended with ſome Lords and Biſhops, (as Repreſentatives of their reſpective Eſtates; and ſo to ſhew to the Commons, that both the other did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſo in judgement in this caſe with the learned Cardinal, that he ſpoke not onely his own, but their Opinions too) He, though at that time ſomewhat indiſpoſed, went accordingly, where he made a very long Speech to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs and abſurdity of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid propoſition, endeavouring to prove by Reaſon, that ſometimes Kings ſhould, and by Example that they had been depoſed, their Subjects being juſtly quit from their Oaths of Allegiance, and ſo not bound to obey them. The Harangue it ſelf being large, I refer you to it in his <hi>Diverſes Oeuvres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this Oration wrought little upon the third Eſtate, which hugely troubled all their Cergy, and the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> then at <hi>Paris;</hi> and <note n="a" place="margin">Hiſt. de <hi>Louis</hi> XIII. pag. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>Scipion Dupleix,</hi> one of the Kings Hiſtoriographers can accuſe the Article with <hi>manifeſt abſurdity,</hi> by which he ſhews his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the reſt in this Doctrine. But the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth ſhew'd himſelf moſt troubled, in his Letter to <hi>Perron,</hi> dated from <hi>Rome, Febr.</hi> 1615. he call'd it a <hi>Deteſtable Decree;</hi> and the voters of it, <hi>Enemies to the Common good and quietneſs, and mortal adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the Chair of</hi> Rome. But at the ſame time gives the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal all the commendations and thanks that can be. But our King <hi>James</hi> was not ſo complemental, nor had he Reaſon: For the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal in his Speech, having ſeveral reflections againſt the Government of <hi>England,</hi> the cruelty of her Laws, the perſecution of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and ſhew'd himſelf mainly concern'd againſt our Oath of Allegiance, which did not a little reflect upon the King himſelf: upon which his Majeſty looking upon this Cardinal as ſomewhat too buſie in putting his Oar in another mans Boat, and ſo concern'd to have ſomewhat of juſtice done him, by his Ambaſſador publickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of this affront to the young King, the Queen-mother and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and himſelf publickly anſwered the Speech. But this was no trouble to the Cardinal, who was hugely complemented and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified from ſeveral Biſhops, and other great perſons, for this his Speech, and valiantly defending the right of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But how to end this grand Controverſie amongſt the Eſtates, was the cauſe of ſome Conſultations: at laſt the King was cunningly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to take it to himſelf; which he did, affirming he underſtood his own Right and Poſſeſſion, and ſo forbad them to determine any thing about it. However, the two <hi>Eſtates</hi> were gallantly careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by two <hi>Breves</hi> from the Pope, ſtufft with Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109877:53"/> and thanks for their Doctrine, and valour for the Church.</p>
                  <p>But enough of <hi>Perron</hi> and the <hi>French Eſtates</hi> (now in a manner neglected in that Kingdom.) And ſhould we look upon our own <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> made onely upon a politick account, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Treaſon, we might ſee it as ſtrongly oppoſed and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, as that of <hi>France:</hi> For no ſooner was it made [that horrid <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-plot</hi> being a main <hi>Motive]</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it to be taken, by two <hi>Breves</hi> ſent into <hi>England;</hi> and preſently began a Paper-ſcuffle on all ſides, <hi>Bellarmine, Gretzer, Parſons, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaeus, Scioppius,</hi> and many others by might and main oppoſing its taking; but they were inſtantly anſwered, not onely by King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, but ſeveral of his learned Subjects, as Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Dr. <hi>Abbot, Carleton, Donne, Prideaux, Burbill, Widdrington</hi> or <hi>Preſton</hi> a <hi>Benedictan</hi> Monk (for which, there were Rods laid in piſs for him by the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe who zealouſly oppoſed it, was one <hi>Adolphus Schulckenius;</hi> but whether a true name or no, I know not: yet he is very furious in behalf of the Popes depoſing of Kings; and this he tells us the Pope may do, by the <note n="a" place="margin">Apologia, pag. 24.</note> Opinion of <hi>all Divines both Ancient and Modern, of all Catholick Lawyers, of Oecumenical Councils and Popes:</hi> and that in this, there is <hi>no</hi>

What effect his Doctrine took, I know not, but 'tis well known that the Fleet came to nothing: and enough of this <hi>Allen,</hi> who for his zeal to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, and the authority of <hi>Rome,</hi> was made Cardinal <hi>de S.

If that be true, that in the Iſland of his birth no venomous or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature can live, 'twas well that he was forthwith tranſplanted to <hi>Italy;</hi> for his native ſoyl, and his malicious humour could never agree: His writings are onely ſtuft with railing and vain repetitions; hath impudence to deny any thing, and affirm what he pleaſeth: his whole books are compoſed of contradictions, all along affirming that Kings may be depoſed, nay, and ſometimes cut off; and yet at the ſame time vindicating himſelf and his Order from diſloyalty; and yet ſo ſhie in his affirmations, though bald in his hints, that his books may be read over to as much purpoſe and ſatisfaction, as one of the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns</hi> preachments, or <hi>Olivers</hi> Speeches: ſo that I ſhould wonder that ſuch a generous Pope as <hi>

The Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> having his great expence in this War againſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and the Jeſuits, [to whom he was a great Benefactor, had a particular Devotion, and was in all things ſway'd by them] to ſpeak loud in his behalf; and beſides, which was no ſmall mover, his Zeal for the cauſe of <hi>Rome (Frederick</hi> being a Proteſtant, and thus laid by) would thus over-ſway the reformed Electors in number, whereby the Empire probably would ſtill be ruled by that Religion. Theſe and other like reaſons, made Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth, and his Nephew and Favourite, Cardinal <hi>Ludoviſio</hi> [who was alſo made Protector of the <hi>Iriſh]</hi> to be earneſt with the Emperour about it; which at laſt (though the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at its firſt motion, ſeem'd not to like) took effect, and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> obtain'd that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour 1623.</p>
                  <p>But that which I moſt aim at in this ſtory, is the Paper of advice or reaſons to perſwade to this action, preſented to the Pope and Cardinals by <hi>Michel Lonigo da Eſle,</hi> belonging to his Holineſs: in which is ſtrongly pleaded for <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ranting and boaſting in a whole beadrole, what pretty pranks and tricks the Popes have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acted over Kings and Emperours, by interdicting, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and depoſing them; altering and changing of Empires and Kingdoms: and in one place ſpeaks boldly and plainly thus:—<hi>It is in the Popes hands, as appeareth by all Hiſtories, to renew the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours in their Empire; to tranſlate the authority of one Nation to another, and utterly to aboliſh the right of Election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that <hi>Rome</hi> did think her power over Kings by way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be juſt and really her own, you may partly gueſs from this following ſtory.</p>

                     <hi>About ſome four or five Months ago, it was conſulted by ſeven or eight of the Learned'ſt Divines that could be choſen, who gave their judgement of it. Their Reaſons are many, but all deduced to this, that the</hi> Popes <hi>Authority in chaſtiſing</hi> Princes <hi>upon a juſt account is</hi> de fide, <hi>and conſequently, cannot be deny'd, when it is call'd into Controverſie, without</hi> denying of our Faith; <hi>nor that the</hi> Pope, <hi>or any other Authority can diſpenſe in this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For if the Queſtion were</hi> de facto, <hi>and not</hi> de jure; <hi>to wit, whether the</hi> Pope <hi>might juſtly in this or that occaſion, excommunicate or depoſe this or that Prince, upon theſe or theſe cauſes; or whether precedent</hi> Popes <hi>have done well therein or no, then might ſome of thoſe reaſons, which you ſay your Friends do alledge, be admitted into conſideration; to wit, whether it would be</hi> in aedificationem <hi>or</hi> deſtructionem, <hi>do hurt or good, be profitable or improfitable, or whether the cauſes be ſufficient or no; for without cauſe none holdeth that the</hi> Pope <hi>may depoſe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the due form of admonition, touched in your Letters were obſerved. But for as much as the Queſtion is</hi> de Poteſtate, <hi>of the</hi> See Apoſtolick <hi>power; what it may do upon any cauſe, or againſt any Catholick Prince whatſoever, theſe conſiderations of temporal hurt cannot enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides theſe, I have conferred the matter with Cardinal</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and ſundry others of great Learning and Conſcience; and all are of Opinion in this caſe, that the form of the Oath as it lyeth, is</hi> Heretical, <hi>and no way may be admitted by him that will not deny the</hi> Catholick <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have had occaſion twice to ſpeak with his</hi> Holineſs; <hi>the firſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Mr.</hi> Thomas Fitzherbert, <hi>where we propoſed certain manners of Mitigation ſuggeſted by Friends,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where to his</hi> Holineſs <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That as for any actual uſing</hi> Cenſures <hi>againſt his</hi> Majeſty, <hi>he meant not, but rather all courteſie; but as for the Authority of the</hi> See Apoſtolick (<hi>to wit, for uſing of</hi> Cenſures) <hi>he was reſolved, and would rather looſe his head, than yeild one jot. The ſecond, he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſome Prieſts did ſeem to incline to the taking of the Oath; he anſwered, He could not hold them for Catholicks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What an enemy this <hi>Parſons</hi> was to his Native Country, we may diſcourſe of hereafter; onely at this time we ſhall go no farther, than what belongs to the Popes power now in hand; yet we may obſerve by the by, that whatever he writ, he never put his own name to it, but ſometimes falſe ones, and ſometimes onely two Letters, which he commonly alter'd in every new Pamphlet, ſtuft up onely with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions; reſolved to let the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> know what he meant, but would never acknowledge any thing to be proved againſt him; yet an indifferent Judge will acknowledge his hints to be bold enough. In one place, thus he tells the Learned <hi>Morton:</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That the Pope can abſolve ſubjects from their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and their Obedience due to their reſpective Princes.</head>
                  <p>ME thinks 'tis an odd humour, that the Pope ſhould be ſo much on Cock-horſe above all the world beſides, as to expect that all Emperours and Kings ſhould ſwear abſolute obedience to him, and yet allow other earthly Monarchs to have but a conditional ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from their Subjects: And this Allegiance, though never ſo ſtrongly tyed up with Oaths and Duty, yet muſt the people be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that an <hi>Item</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> can quit them from its Obligation, as poor <hi>Hortenſius</hi> believed himſelf to be King of <hi>Poland,</hi> becauſe Roguiſh <hi>Francion</hi> and others told him ſo.</p>
                  <p>Though we abhor the action, yet we cannot chuſe but ſmile ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to ſee how many by the knavery of ſome Polititians, are gull'd into villany: many of our wicked States-men, (as the Devil turns himſelf into an Angel of Light) wrap themſelves in Religon to catch thoſe who know nothing of it but the word. And though we be tyed to Allegiance, with the ſtricteſt bonds of Birth and Oaths; yet from theſe, if occaſion ſerve, the <hi>Grandees</hi> of Faction will eaſe us, either, as one Nail drives out another, by taking a contradictory Oath to the former, or ſome way or other, procuring or making of and to our ſelves an Abſolution; the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> being the Chief Maſters of this Faculty.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> after they had above two years impiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd againſt their King and Church, to make their actions more plauſible to the Vulgar, took that abominable <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt both, and ſo declaring their diſobligation to either, as if a latter unlawful Oath could quit one of the former, which, Law, Religion and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did bind him to. And I cannot but think here of the impious <hi>Guiſian</hi> league in <hi>France,</hi> who having fought a great while againſt their King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and declared themſelves not obliged to their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him; yet as a pretty trick to fool the world, they ſent to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, that he would declare their war <note place="margin">Veſtram, Beatiſſime Pater, opem imploram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In one place he ſeems to vapour with his Compact, though I would gladly know when, where, by whom, and how in <hi>England,</hi> (for that's his drift) this Agreement was, and made conditional? and by what Laws the people are made Judges and Puniſhers? but let us hear the Jeſuit himſelf ſpeak.—</p>
                  <p>—<hi>Yea, with ſuch plain Exceptions, Promiſes, and Oaths of both</hi>

                     <hi>Parties (I mean between the King and Common-wealth at the day of his admiſſion or Coronation) as if the ſame be not kept, but wilfully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on either part, then is the other not bound to obſerve his Promiſe neither, though never ſo ſolemnly made or ſworn; for that in all Bargains, Agreements and Contracts, where one Party is bound mutually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally to the other by Oath, Vow, or Condition, there, if one ſide go from his promiſe, the other ſtandeth not obliged to perform his.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And then again to weaken the ſucceſſion by blood, and to make an Heir-apparent but a trifle, and to make the outward Ceremonies too much eſſential to the Office, he thus in his fury gives you his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Decree:—</p>

                  <p>And is not this as clear as the noon-day, and as plain as a Pike-ſtaff? is not this down-right to call a ſpade a ſpade, and to ſay that Kings may be deprived, and then kill'd by any body? Nor was this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſet down without great conſideration, and firmly believed to be true, not onely by <hi>Suarez,</hi> but the chief of <hi>Portugal</hi> and others.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109877:378"/> in <hi>England,</hi> he declared his conſent ſo freely to his Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <note place="margin">

                  <p>That it was held in great veneration with others, cannot be denyed: for we ſhall ſcarce ſee a book honour'd with ſuch cenſures of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. <hi>Alphonſo à Caſtello Branco,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coimbria,</hi> and Privy Councellor to the King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the Third, declares that <hi>he hath read it exactly over, and findes all things in it to agree to the holy Scriptures, Apoſtolical Traditions, General Councils, and Papal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Fernando Martiner Maſcaregnus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sylvis</hi> ſaith, that he hath alſo read it over, and findes nothing in it but what is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. And <hi>Martiner Alonſo à Mello,</hi> another Privy Councellor and Biſhop of <hi>Lamego</hi> ſaith alſo that he hath read it over, and thinks it worthy to be publiſht, for the publick good of Chriſtendom. And the Provincial Jeſuits of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> allow it the ſame priviledges, and ſo doth the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Nor is this all, but the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity of <hi>Alcala de Henarez,</hi> after a ſerious view and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, declare that <hi>there is nothing in it contrary to the</hi> Roman <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, nor any thing in it, but what ought to be approved of and commended, every thing being according to their own opinions and judgements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this put together, is enough to blot out the bad reception it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Senators of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Kings Murther then freſh in their memories, and their hatred to the Jeſuits being ſtrong motives. As for the <hi>Sorbone</hi> (an Aſſociation really to be honour'd in many things) its Doctors, as moſt of other Convocations, are oft ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on with intereſt and faction, that many times in the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable things, we ſhall finde their Decrees to claſh one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, this ancient Colledge of <hi>Sorbone</hi> [built about 1250, by <hi>Robert de Sorbone]</hi> hath for ſeveral ages kept up a great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſplendour; but they have ſomewhat been troubled by the ſpringing up of the Jeſuits, with whom, I may ſay, they and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity have had a continual bickering for this hundred years, and of late have ſomething loſt ground, eſpecially at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Fathers carry the bell away clearly from the Doctors, both in repute, authority and preferments, which are ſuch conſiderable Arguments, that of late times, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince 1650, the intereſt of the Jeſuits hath got in a manner the upper hand in the very Colledge of <hi>Sorbone</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> the latter of which hath onely a company of <hi>Curates,</hi> too weak to oppoſe againſt the ſubtile <hi>Loyoliſts;</hi> and if the ſecular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do not intervene, they will all in time ſubmit to the Principles and ſway of the wily Fathers of <hi>Clermont.</hi> And 'tis very probable, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> muſt either fall in the hight of their pride, like the <hi>Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templers,</hi> or elſe they will quite ruine the glory, if not the being of other Religious Orders: more of envy than emulation ſtill breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them.</p>
                  <p>But it is not the Jeſuits onely who are guilty in ſpreading theſe wicked Doctrines, but others too; for <hi>Petrus de Ledeſma,</hi> a noted <hi>Dominican</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> having propoſed this Queſtion, <hi>What may the people do, when a lawful King tyrannizeth over them?</hi> and the

                  <p>The <hi>Guiſian</hi> Faction in <hi>France,</hi> making a firm League or <hi>Covenant,</hi> pretending to maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, but at laſt bandy'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, fill'd the Nation full of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rebellion: And every man fought (as 'tis the faſhion in all ſuch troubles) according as he was qualified, ſo that there was not onely ſlaſhing, ſcolding and curſing, but ſcribling too. At laſt the <hi>Roman-Covenanters</hi> grew ſo ſtubborn, that they were reſolved not to acknowledge <hi>Henry</hi> for their King: and in vindication of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, one of their chief <hi>Boutefeu's</hi> ſets himſelf to write; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Preſs had done working, the King was murdred by one of their Gang, <hi>viz.

                  <p>This is plain enough to ſhew his judgement: but when he heard that the King was murdered, then he rejoyced to the purpoſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was done to the <note n="h" place="margin">Id. P. 450.</note>

                  <p>But probably 'twill be retorted that 'tis but a Pamphlet, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor not putting his name to it, and ſo not to be regarded. 'Tis true, no name is to it, it being not ſafe ſo to do when it came out, for then <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was King, and went on proſperouſly againſt the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> and the Author then amongſt them, his name was <hi>Jehan Boucher,</hi> born in <hi>Paris</hi> of a good Family, and was Preacher at St. <hi>Benits,</hi> the ancienteſt Church, I think, in that City; but an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable fire-band amongſt the <hi>Covenanters:</hi> and as he had thus ſhew'd himſelf an enemy againſt his Soveraign <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> ſo did he

                  <p>An obſcure piece of Policy for Rebels thus to be protected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, ſince 'tis one of the main encouragements to Treaſon, (and this may be every Monarchs caſe) for the Villain to know, that, let fortune be never ſo much his enemy in his undertakings, yet he may be ſecure in anothers Dominions, where he may take breath, and it may be, be encouraged to another enterpriſe: But theſe things are above me, and not to my purpoſe.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That it is the Opinion of their Popes and Councils, that Kings may be depoſed.</head>
                  <p>HAving hitherto ſeen the Opinions of private perſons, yet thoſe of the greateſt repute amongſt them; we ſhall now aſcend a little higher, and with them to their moſt authentick Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth: but whether this Supremacie remain in the <hi>Pope,</hi> or a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council;</hi> I muſt yet leave to the determination of their <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Doctors: and yet 'tis ſtrange that hitherto they will not agree to ſettle infallibility; that that which they make the judge of other Articles, muſt thus it ſelf want a certain foundation by Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent.</p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>Councils,</hi> if practice may interpret, (and I am ſure in this caſe they make it none of their leaſt Arguments) we ſhall finde that Princes may be lawfully depoſed, and that confirm'd by the grandeur of ſuch meetings. Thus their great Hiſtorian Cardinal <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> aſſures us that the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was exautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by two <hi>Synods</hi> at <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>And as I do not trouble my ſelf to interpret any thing in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> Canon, ſeeing the chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Champions, <hi>Leſſius, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, Bellarmine</hi> and others, declare expreſly that it is meant of the Popes Authority over Kings, and for their depoſing; ſo ſhall I not wrangle with any concerning that of <hi>Trent,</hi> a Council of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that they make it the ſtandard of their Faith.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt <hi>Seſſion</hi> of this <hi>Trent</hi> political Convention, <hi>Duels</hi> were <note place="margin">Seſſ. 25. c. 19.</note> cenſured as unlawful [and indeed, no honeſt, true and faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can fight one, he taking to himſelf power of his own life, and that of his fellow-ſubjects, againſt Law, Religion and Prerogative] and declares thoſe Princes <hi>to be held as deprived</hi> of thoſe places, where they permit them. What was the meaning of the words of this Decree, I ſhall ſay nothing my ſelf, but tell you, that the <hi>French</hi> Church took it to deprive Kings, for which they bogled at it; and they had more reaſon to underſtand the meaning of it, than any now: yet if theſe grave Divines miſtook the ſence of that Chapter, 'tis no fault of mine, let the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bandy it out amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and either tell us the reaſon, why that Council is not exactly received in <hi>France,</hi> and ſo whether they be Hereticks or no, in not complying with a General Council as they call it, or that every part of it is in force there, and how it came to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Theſe at this time may ſatisfie, to ſhew in what a tottering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Councils makes Kings to ſtand in.

                  <p>To prevent the thruſting of theſe Abuſes upon us, the Noble Prince <hi>Henry</hi> had ſome thoughts to erect a <hi>Royal Library,</hi> with all ſorts of Books and Editions; as I think betwixt St. <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Muze.</hi> And in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> preſented to the aforeſaid Prince, both to forward and to ſhew the means to carry on ſuch a glorious deſign: I finde theſe following words (according to my Manuſcript) confirming the former obſervation of Dr. <note n="d" place="margin">It would be well if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Books were re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>The Pope gathereth up all the Manuſcripts he can into his Library the</hi> Vatican, <hi>and there uſeth them at his pleaſure. One of their tricks is Notorious, they have men that can counterfeit any hand, and write the old hands that were written 500 and 1000 years ago; then they have an artificial Ink, which within three days after the writing, looks as it had been written 500 years afore. Thus having altered and taken out all that made for us, they ſuppreſs the old true Copies, and produce theſe new ones (they written by themſelves as afore) as the Authentical Books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this was alſo deſigned a noble maintenance for the Library-Keepers, and other Officers thereunto belonging, to incourage their attendance and pains; as alſo, for Factors in Forreign pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this I could wiſh, that we were as buſie in printing all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils (the better to diſcover the fraud in ſome Editions) as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> beyond Seas are; it being a hard caſe, that otherwiſe we muſt relye upon their Editions, and we are not ignorant of unhandſome dealings amongſt them in this very buſineſs. <hi>Binius</hi> we know takes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109877:87"/> ſome of his counſels <hi>verbatim</hi> out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> one very partial, and hath left ſeveral neceſſary things out in his Volumns, becauſe againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were ſet down by <hi>Crabbe</hi> (now two hard to be got) and ſeveral Councils, eſpecially of our own Nation, are not completed in the late <hi>Pariſian</hi> Edition in 36 Tomes, beſides <hi>L' Abbe</hi> the Publiſher of them is thought and <note n="a" place="margin">See the pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the new Hereſie of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1666, p. 102, 103, 104, 105, &amp;c.</note> judged to be very partial.</p>

Dr. <hi>James</hi> once in a <hi>Convocation</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> moved ſtrongly for theſe reviews and reprinting of the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but private intereſt and faction was too ſtrong, either to beſtow ſo much coſt or time upon ſuch a noble and publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>And to theſe I could wiſh that there were ſome care taken to reprint ſome of the Ancient Hiſtorians of Church and State; the want of which in time may put us to a loſs in dealing with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; the old Editions being very hard to come by, we muſt then (if care be not taken to the contrary) be content to make uſe of ſuch falſe and ſpurious ware as our Enemies will thurſt upon us. And that this complaint is not without good reaſon; many inſtances might be brought of their abuſing us in this ſort: But at this time for Example ſake, I ſhall onely make uſe of one, <hi>viz. Aubertus Miraeus</hi> of <hi>Brabant,</hi> a great Antiquary, and a famous Schollar, and one that hath been much read in Church-Hiſtory; for which things he hath got a fame amongſt the Learned, his ſeveral works having been gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily read of all ſorts, and that with ſome repute to the Author. This great and noted man, nay, and a Church-man too, being Canon of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> can we think that his ſtudy was to deceive Poſterity, and publickly endeavour to cheat the world with his, or the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others?</p>
                  <p>Well, do but peruſe his Edition of <hi>Sigebertus,</hi> that ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of above 500 years ſtanding; and amongſt other places, look upon him in the years 773 and 4; compare them with other old E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and ſee how he hath ſometimes cut off, ſometimes added, and other times perverted the true ſence; and all this to take away ſome authority from the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>But to this may be objected, that he followed ſome ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts or other; 'tis true, 'tis an objection with himſelf ſoon made; but what ſmall reaſon we have to believe this onely ſaying ſo, ſhall be left to the judgement of any man by this following ſtory. This <hi>Miraeus</hi> alſo ſet forth a <note n="d" place="margin">Notitia Epiſcopatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> Regiſter or Breviary of Biſhopricks, with ſome ſmall Annotations of his own: and becauſe formerly there hath been ſome diſpute of theſe things, that this Tract of his may carry the more Authority with it: In his very Title Page, he aſſures
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109877:88"/> all the world, that this his <hi>Notitia</hi> is printed <note n="a" place="margin">Ex vetuſto Codice ante annos fere quingentos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripto.</note> according to an Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript almoſt 500 years old.</p>
                  <p>And why may we not believe this good man of <hi>Bruxels?</hi> for if Antiquity ſtudy to cheat the world with falſe Copies; well may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are apt to take things upon truſt run into errors, and I fear this dealing hath too much power upon Faith and Religion. But to ſhew this to be a villanous forgery, I ſhall paſs by other Countries, and onely come to our own of <hi>England;</hi> though me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks 'tis odd, if this Manuſcript be ſo ancient, that he ſhould not put down <hi>Dunkeld</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>Roſs, Brechin</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blane,</hi> ſince they were all founded by one and the ſame King, <hi>viz.</hi> that pious and vertuous King <hi>David,</hi> who gave ſo much to the Church from his own Crown-lands.</p>
                  <p>But to make the knavery more viſible, lets ſee his dealing and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of <hi>England:</hi> In which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with his naming <hi>Cheſter</hi> or <hi>Gloceſter</hi> amongſt our Biſhopricks, becauſe formerly ſome of the Biſhops of <hi>Liechfield</hi> were ignorantly call'd Biſhops of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> becauſe one or two of them once lived there; and ſome think that <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was an Epiſcopal See in or before the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, but not under that name, but <hi>Cluvienſis.</hi> But waving theſe, though good enough to diſcover the cheat, I deſire the Reader to conſider this following, againſt which there can be no exception, <hi>viz.</hi> if this <hi>Manuſcript</hi> was almoſt 500 years old, how comes it to fet down f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe cheats ſhould oblige us to ſtudy prevention in time, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hereafter they may run us down by their falſe Fathers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authorities: and when they have thus forced us onely to the protection of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> an endleſs diſpute may begin about the <hi>variae lectiones;</hi> by which means the poor people and truth may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by both parties. But ſince they ſtand moſt upon Authority and Quotations, 'tis fitting we ſhould be more careful, that they do not cheat us with falſe play.</p>
                  <p>But enough of this, and the ſuppoſed <hi>Donation,</hi> which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> did once prettily confute, and ſo ſhake off a cloſe demand. <note place="margin">

                  <p>As for the election of the preſent Pope <note n="e" place="margin">An. 1655.</note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, there was as much faction and intereſt, as any of the reſt; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> having one party there, headed by the two Cardinals <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, Charles</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the firſt, Uncle; the laſt, Brother to the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had their Creatures alſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the two <hi>Barberini, Francis,</hi> and <hi>Antonio</hi> the firſt, calling himſelf Protector of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And beſides theſe there was a third intereſt conſiſting againſt of ſeveral Cardinals, and in <hi>Rome</hi> call'd the <hi>Squadrone Volante,</hi> who would ſeem to be indifferent to the other two Parties; and Cardinal <hi>Imperiale</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> was head of this Troop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacchetti</hi> had not onely <hi>Barberini,</hi> but the <hi>Squadrone Volante,</hi> and ſome others zealous for him; yet though the moſt deſired by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was held the beſt and worſt worthy amongſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, he loſt it upon the ſame account, <hi>(viz.</hi> as a lover of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Mazarini)</hi> as he had done in the former <hi>Conclave.</hi> However, for ſometime many Cardinals were ſo reſolved for him, that 'twas ſaid, That they would <note n="f" place="margin">O Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetti, O Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taletta.</note> 
                     <hi>either have him Pope or dye there:</hi> And for a long time at every ſcrutiny he had XXXIII Votes, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which, every one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction in their Scheduls onely writ

                  <p>By which means they kept unanimous and intire, by not dividing themſelves in theſe ſcrutinies to other Candidate Cardinals: but this obſtinacie of both parties ſo lengthned the <hi>Conclave,</hi> that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

                     <hi>Chigi</hi> [now Pope] ſaid merrily, that a Pope would never be choſen, till the Cardinals <hi>Nemini</hi> and <hi>Triginti tria</hi> could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Corrado</hi> had ſeveral friends, but thoſe of <hi>Caſtile</hi> reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, him becauſe <hi>Barberini</hi> was for him, though he might have ſerved being a ſevere Canoniſt, and in truth knew nothing elſe; yet this may be enough, ſince of late times they have not choſen a Pope, who had ſtudied Divinity, but onely ſome Canon-law or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caraffa</hi> was thought on, but the <hi>French</hi> reject him, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intended his promotion; however, his death at the ſame time ended the diſpute. As for Cardinal <hi>Rapaccioli</hi> he had both hopes and many friends in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> who voted ſtoutly for him; but <hi>de Medici</hi> and that party oppoſed him, and Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> in writing objected againſt him, that he had cauſed Prayers to be ſaid, that the Devils ſins might be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory of which, being pretty odd and unuſual, take as they report it. At <hi>Teramo</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of which place this Cardinal was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, one being poſſeſt with a Devil, <hi>Rapaccioli</hi> for curioſity ſake went to diſcourſe with it; and amongſt other things, asked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>if he indured great torments;</hi> the Devil replyed, <hi>exceeding great:</hi> The Cardinal inquired of him, <hi>Why he did not repent for his ſins, the cauſes of his puniſhment?</hi> The ſpirit replyed, That <hi>he had earneſtly repented, but without any benefit. Then,</hi> quoth the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>if God ſhould pardon you, would you take ſuch a forgiveneſs and mercy in good part?</hi> To which the Spirit conſenting, <hi>Rapacci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli</hi> commanded prayers to be ſaid to God, that the Devils ſins might be remitted and forgiven him.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Maculano,</hi> or St. <hi>Clement</hi> had once ſome hopes, having many votes, but he had to oppoſe him Madam <note n="a" place="margin">Her life is lately written by the well known <hi>Gualdo:</hi> In it the world may ſee what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhe was, and how ſhe ruled Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X, &amp; the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Several others were thought on, and adhered to, but to no purpoſe, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill oppſing thoſe the <hi>French</hi> would have; and thoſe, whom the Catholick King deſired. At laſt, after they had thus bafled, jugled, and out-plotted one another for a quarter of a year; Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazarini</hi> ſends privately to <hi>Barberini</hi> from <hi>Paris</hi> his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chigi;</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> alſo had ſome minde to him, being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his dexterous carriage at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1644, and what the Emperour and <hi>Austria</hi> approve of, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſually

Beſides this, the <hi>Squadrone Volante,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Pamfilii</hi> were his Friends, being made Cardinal but three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Innocent;</hi> and he had had ſome ſufferings formerly in this <hi>Conclave;</hi> and ſo at laſt, though quite contrary to the firſt deſign, was this Cardinal <hi>Fabio Chigi</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> choſen Pope, and call'd himſelf <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, from his Relation, both as Country and Kindred to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Popes were formerly choſen by the ſuffrages of the Clergy then preſent, though of inferiour rank: After this, the power of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was reſtrain'd onely to Cardinals; and theſe ſometimes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, but falling into divers ſchiſms, one party holding him for Pope who they gave their votes for, others acknowledging none but whom they nominated, and ſometimes a third party would ſtand to another: but to prevent this, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, who had like to have loſt the Popedom by theſe means, in a <note n="a" place="margin">1179.</note>

                     <p>And to carry it on more cleerly, <note n="g" place="margin">An. 774.</note> 
                        <hi>Baronius</hi> takes upon him to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109877:93"/> rail dapperly againſt the ancient and noted Chronologer <hi>Sigeber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Gemblacenſis (i. e.</hi> of <hi>Gemblaurs</hi> in <hi>Brabant)</hi> looking upon him as an Enemy to the Church, for <note n="a" place="margin">An 773.</note> affirming ſuch a ſtory, which the Cardinal would perſwade us to be a meer forgery.</p>
                     <p>But before he do this, he muſt alſo cleer the <hi>Canon-law</hi> from the ſame crime; and thus he indeavours to do it: He cannot deny but that this ſtorie and <hi>Order</hi> is in the <hi>Decrees;</hi> nor will he accuſe <hi>Gratian,</hi> the Collector of them, to have been diſhoneſt in putting it amongſt the reſt: How then? onely that <hi>Gratian</hi> here might not be careful enough, to conſider what he did, and ſo took it out of <hi>Sigebertus,</hi> and put it down for authentick in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
                     <p>But by the Cardinals favour, I ſhall bring this Argument for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Canon, which after ſo much pains he holds forth to diſprove it; for they both living at the ſame time, and hitting ſo exactly upon the ſame ſtorie, doth the more confirm its authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it being very probable that neither of them ſaw one anothers Writings, living ſo far diſtant, as the one in <hi>Brabant,</hi> the other in <hi>Italy;</hi> and in thoſe days there was neither friendſhip or correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie between thoſe places; if there had been, 'tis probable had the Authors known one another, they had been as great Enemies as their Maſters, <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh.</p>

                     <p>But before I leave this, I cannot but take notice of one pretty cheat. I told you formerly of the knavery of their Antiquary <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Miraeus</hi> in his corrupting ancient Authors; and here he is tardy again: for in his Edition of <hi>Sigebertus</hi> he quite leaves out this whole ſtorie, as if the Author had writ no ſuch thing; whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf aſſures the world that <hi>Sigebert</hi> writ it, and rants againſt him bitterly for ſo doing; nor hath any queſtioned the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of old Editions 'till this <hi>Miraeus,</hi> whom I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (againſt his <hi>Notitia Epiſcopatuum)</hi> to be a notorious forger, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the putting forth of his own things for ancient Manuſcripts; and ſo no credit to be given to him, let him pretend what ancient Copies he pleaſeth. I have ſeen one ancient Manuſcript of <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi> which formerly belong'd to our famous Antiquary Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> but to this place I can ſay nothing of it, becauſe this very place, with above an hundred years beſides, have been, God knows how and when, convey'd from the reſt of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
                     <p>This Grant of <hi>Adrian</hi> is alſo mentioned (according to their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law)</hi> by Pope <note n="e" place="margin">Diſt 63. c. <hi>In Synodo.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Leo</hi> the Eighth, in his confeſſion of the ſame Priviledges of electing of Popes, to the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the Firſt. But 'tis to ſmall purpoſe to trouble my ſelf any more about theſe things; ſince, long ago, they have deny'd any ſuch prerogative to remain in Temporal Authority; nor will they grant to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or Kings any intereſt of ſuch an Election, but this onely to be done by the Cardinals, who no doubt will chuſe according to their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109877:93"/> Conſciences, and not by favour or reward, every one of them ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo to do, before every ſcrutiny.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Oath.</hi> Teſtor Chriſtum Dominum, qui me judicarus eſt, me Eligere quem ſecundum Deum judico Eligi Debere, &amp; quod i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in Acceſſu praeſtabo.</q>
                     <p>And yet when we conſider the ſtrange factions, canvaſings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> we might think that intereſt ſway'd more there, than this Oath or Conſcience. Add to this, that there are always ſome <hi>Cardinals,</hi> whoſe own revenues will ſcarce keep them in that ſplendour befitting the red Hat: And theſe are commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-Penſioners to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> from whoſe Kings they receive yearly ſtipends; and ſo muſt always act according to the pleaſure of their Pay-Maſter. Add further, that at every Election the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals act under ſeveral Chieftains; and though <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in a manner divide the <hi>Conclave,</hi> yet others, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> have alſo their Creatures there, who beſtir themſelves vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly for the deſigns of theſe their Lay-Patrons; who though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from voting, yet are the onely chuſers of the Pope by their thus ruling the Cardinals.</p>
                     <p>As for inſtance, the death of a Pope being known, 'tis the cuſtom of the King of <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> to ſend inſtructions to his Ambaſſadour, or ſome other Confident at <hi>Rome,</hi> how to carry on the <hi>Conclave,</hi> that a friend of his might be choſen; and alſo nominates five or ſix, any of which he is willing to be Pope; and at the ſame time ſends the names of ſome others, whom by no means he will not allow to be elected; by which means Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> loſt the Title of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> wholly excluding him, for <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1097. This Tract is left out in ſome Edition of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made an <hi>Edict</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. See <hi>D'Avily</hi> les Eſtats, p. 235.</note> ſcratching a little upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The inſtructions being come, the Cardinals of his Faction act accordingly; And he (though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Chair never ſo much; as for Example, <hi>Baronius)</hi> who is thus excepted againſt by a King, 'tis an hundred to one he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change his red Hat for a Triple Crown.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, ſometimes a few Cardinals in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> when they ſee they cannot bring their own ends about, exclaim pittifully againſt this <hi>mode</hi> of ſubmitting their ſuffrages and conſciences to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this or that King; and now and then Pen and Paper are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in making little Tracts of Oppoſitions and Juſtifications of ſuch Actions; but this ſcribling and crying out of a few Cardinals, never hinders the reſt from proſecuting their intended deſigns. And thus we ſee that yet the Temporal Authority hath a main ſtroke, if not all, in the election of Popes.</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but ſmile at <hi>Thomas Bozius,</hi> who makes a great deal of noiſe and bluſtering in behalf of the Popes juriſdiction; and <note place="margin">De <hi>Italiae</hi> ſtatu, lib. 4. c. 3. p. 388. 390.</note> what an horrid danger and judgement 'twill be, to croſs the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, ſaith he, the Emperours <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third reſtrained the Popes of ſome Temporal Power; and then the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Heruli</hi> waſted <hi>Italy.</hi> Again, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> made a Law, that the Popes ſhould not be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, without firſt conſulting the Emperour, and paying a certain <note place="margin">Id. p. 395.</note>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:109877:94"/> ſum of money for it; and ſo the Plague or Peſtilence ſeis'd upon <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Totila</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> took <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, long after this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law was made, that the Pope ſhould not be conſecrated, but in the preſence of the Emperours or their Deputies; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <note place="margin">Pag. 403.</note> Plagues, great Earth-quakes troubled <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Huns</hi> lorded it there alſo. And ſuchlike conſequences as theſe he hath ſtore of, and all as true as the Star fell down, and therefore the Aſtronomer ſhot it with his <hi>Jacobs-ſtaff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And truely, the reſt is much after the ſame faſhion, the ſum of his whole Book being onely this: <hi>Italy</hi> is more fruitful, hath more and greater Cities and Towns, brave Monaſteries and Churches, better Houſes and Colledges, and more knowing men and women for theſe laſt twelve hundred years, than it was or had before; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope and his Authority is the greateſt happineſs that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And is not this a notable wonder, that building ſhould increaſe in ſo many hundred years? If this way of Argumentizing be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, 'tis coming time, not Scripture or Antiquity, that muſt prove any Religion, the which upon this account muſt grow better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſo as they ſay, Modern Proteſtantiſm muſt be held a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bleſſing and benefit than that which they call ancient Popery, in thoſe Nations where the reformed Religion bears the ſway.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus haſtily diſcours'd ſomething concerning the Election of Popes, it will not be amiſs to add theſe few following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which may add ſome light to the buſineſs; and by a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution, may be of greater conſideration, than at this time I ſhall trouble my ſelf withal, but leave it to the cenſure of every man.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth [who began his Popedom in 1605] there lived in <hi>Italy</hi> a great Scholar, and a ſevere <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, who being troubled at the odd carriage of the Popes and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, thought it convenient to have a General Council to rectifie all; but knowing the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to have a natural averſneſs from this, look'd upon himſelf obliged, as a true ſon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to endeavour as much as lay in his power, the promotion of ſuch a publick benefit to his Religion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, (knowing the Popes againſt it) he drew up a <note n="a" place="margin">Supplicatio ad Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Reges, Principes, ſuper cauſis Generalis Concilii convocandi.</note> Petition to the Emperour and other Chriſtian Kings, to bring this noble and charitable deſign about. And poſſibly fearing, that if this his ſupplication ſhould onely come into the hands of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick perſwaſion, it might there be ſtifled by the over-perſwaſion of their intereſted Favourites and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors: To prevent this, ſeeing our King <hi>James</hi> of a publick ſpirit for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109877:94"/> the benefit of the Church; he directs it onely to him, that by his means his neceſſitating reaſons might be diſcover'd to the Emperour and the other Chriſtian Princes. Upon this the Author <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1611.</note> dyeth at <hi>Rome,</hi> leaves this <hi>Petition</hi> with a dear Friend of his, who delivers it to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman then there, who accordingly convey'd it to King <hi>James,</hi> who preſently diſpers'd it all <hi>Europe</hi> over.</p>
                     <p>As for the Author, I ſhall poſitively ſay nothing, but that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears one to have been very well verſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs: the common opinion is, that it was the famous <hi>Neapolitan Civilian</hi> Dr. <hi>Marta,</hi> of whom we have formerly hinted; and indeed his very ſubſcribing himſelf to the Supplication <hi>NOV<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S HOMO,</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that he had now in ſomething changed his Opinion: and we cannot but obſerve that this Supplication carryeth all along a grand reſpect and veneration to Temporal Authority over <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf in ſome things; whereas Dr. <hi>Marta</hi> in his other Volumes is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute a Champion for the Popes very Temporal Prerogative, that he ſcrews up the power and juriſdiction of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops, even to trample upon all other Potentates in this world. If <hi>Marta</hi> be the man, it muſt be the diſcovery of ſome grand iniquities that could thus alienate his affection from Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth.</p>
                     <p>In this his diſcourſe is indeavoured to prove a failing in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Popes, raiſing the Foundation from the Simoniacal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth. But probably one might fetch a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſe than this, even by viewing over their own ſchiſms, where ſometimes we ſhall finde ſuch odd chopping and changing of Popes, that the wiſeſt then living could not tell which or where was the Head of the Church; and yet every party creating Cardinals, and declaring himſelf Chriſt's Vicar. Now this is certain, [ſince the time they have acknowledged that none but Cardinals can elect a Pope] that if ever a Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was choſen by thoſe Cardinals who were created by an Antipope, or one not truely (as they ſay) Chriſt's Vicar, that then ſuch an Election is of no validity, being made by thoſe who were not truely Cardinals, and ſo wanted an authentick Authority to make ſuch an election. And if the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once fail, I know not how or when it muſt begin again.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the aforeſaid <hi>Italian</hi> foundeth his main deſign upon <hi>Simony,</hi> I ſhall onely Preface a little on the ſame crying ſin, and that but a few years before his <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth.</p>

                     <p>After the death of this <hi>Alexander,</hi> XXXVII Cardinals, after ſome diſturbance and fears, enter into the <hi>Conclave,</hi> to elect another Pope; and of this little number, there were XXIV of this <hi>Alexanders</hi> Creation, whoſe names you ſee mark'd with this •. In this <hi>Conclave</hi> was <hi>Pius</hi> the Third choſen; but how could he be legally elected, if almoſt two parts in three of the Cardinals had no lawful voice?</p>
                     <p>But again, ſuppoſing all the Cardinals to belegally created; yet, how can the election of this <hi>Pius</hi> be true and lawful, ſeeing he was ſo far from having the voices of two parts in three, or a Majority (though this would not make a true election) that he onely obtain'd the <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>What in part hath been objected againſt <hi>Pius</hi> the Third, may alſo paſs upon <hi>Julius</hi> the Second: for though at his election there were XXXVII Cardinals in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> yet XXVI were of <hi>Alexanders</hi> creation: And if this ſtand good, then we may affirm that there hath been no true Pope ſince.</p>
                     <p>But let us proceed: this <hi>Julius</hi> the Second (it may be being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the clamours againſt the Simoniacal election of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, a Pope compoſed of wickedneſs) with the conſent of his Cardinals in Conſiſtory, made a notable <hi>Bull</hi> to prevent theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, part of which take as followeth.</p>

                     <p>Having thus ſeen the ſevere Bull for the avoiding and annihilating of Elections obtain'd by <hi>Simony,</hi> or ſuchlike illegal means; let us now ſee whether it hath been obſerved or no: and if not, according to their own Law, down falleth ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth being <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1585.</note> dead, the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in the <hi>Conclave</hi> according to cuſtom fell into ſeveral Factions about the Election; ſome being for <hi>de la Terre,</hi> ſome for <hi>Tarneſius,</hi> ſome approved <hi>Savellius,</hi> others favour'd <hi>Sertettus; Caſtagneus</hi> wanted not Friends, <hi>Paleotto</hi> had hopes, and others were now and then thought on: <hi>Ferneſius</hi> headed one party, <hi>Altemps</hi> another, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drino</hi> a third; S. <hi>Sixtus</hi> by his Authority carryed a great ſtroke there, <hi>de Medici</hi> ruled ſome; and <hi>Aloyſius de Eſte,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> had a great party of Cardinals at his Devotion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe heads of intereſt drawing ſeveral ways, inlarged the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: at laſt Cardinal <hi>Montalto</hi> had ſome hopes, finding <hi>Alexandrino</hi> and <hi>de Medici</hi> his Friends, and at laſt to ſtand really for him; but theſe with their dependants not being ſtrong enough to carry it, he gets ſome to tamper with S. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> whilſt himſelf feels the pulſe of <hi>Aloyſius de Eſte,</hi> with whom at laſt he ſtrikes up a Bargain, the Condition of which was this: That whereas there was one <hi>Hieronymus Matthaeus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop of great eſteem in the Court, but one that <hi>de Eſte</hi> above all men hated; that if <hi>Montalto</hi> would promiſe never to make this <hi>Matthaeus</hi> Cardinal, <hi>Aloyſius</hi> would give his own voyce, and the ſuffrages of all thoſe Cardinals who were many depending on him, to make the ſaid <hi>Montalto</hi> Pope: this was agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109877:97"/> them; to which <hi>Montalto</hi> did not onely give him his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by mouth, but by open writing ſubſcribed and ratified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, and ſo he carryed the Popedom from all the reſt, and call'd himſelf <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth.</p>
                     <p>But now let us ſee how things work'd to bring this Simoniacal Bargain to light. Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> after this his Election, having got what he aimed at, broke his Promiſe and Faith made to <hi>de Este,</hi> and contrary thereunto, made <hi>Hieronimo Mattheo</hi> Cardinal: which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs <hi>Aloyſius</hi> took ſo much to heart, ſeeing his Enemies thus advanced to affront him, that he fell deadly ſick; but before his death, to be revenged of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> he ſent the Agreement and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, even the very Original ſigned with <hi>Montalto</hi>'s hand, to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain;</hi> who thereupon in the year 1589, ſent the Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give the Pope notice hereof, and to intimate to him the preſent neceſſity of a <hi>General Council</hi> concerning this Simoniacal Election; and to require the Cardinals (created by his Predeceſſors) and others of the Clergy, to appear in the ſaid Council, which he intended to hold at <hi>Sivil</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> liking this well enough, having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time fallen out with the Pope, for not ſhewing himſelf vigorous for his <hi>Caſtilian</hi> intereſt, then troubling <hi>France:</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Duke <hi>Seſſa</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome, Sixtus</hi> dyed, and ſo this Council for a new Election fell to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Yet the ſtory of this Simoniacal Election was not forgot; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that when a few years after <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth [who was made Cardinal by the aforeſaid <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, and to whoſe Election about thirty illegal Cardinals concur'd] did abſolve <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and ſo acknowledged him King of <hi>France,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> openly undertook to prove, that this <hi>Clement</hi> was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully elected Pope, and ſo had no power to abſolve King <hi>Henry;</hi> to which purpoſe alſo ſeveral Books were writ by them. For if <hi>Sixtus</hi> was guilty of <hi>Simony,</hi> then by the Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second he was no true and lawful Pope, and ſo could not make Cardinals, nor theſe ſo ſuppoſed to be created, to elect a Pope: However, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to coyn theſe thirty three Cardinals.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Seventh, who dyed a few days after; and after him, not without a great deal of clutter, canvaſſing and faction, was choſen Cardinal <hi>Sfondratus,</hi> who call'd himſelf <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourteenth: and in this <hi>Conclave</hi> was as many of <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, as in the former headed by <hi>Montalto:</hi> after ten Months this Biſhops dyed; and after the ſame way was Cardinal <hi>Facchinetto</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen, who call'd himſelf <hi>Innocent</hi> the Ninth, who after two Months rule alſo dyed.</p>
                     <p>And the next that ſat in the Chair, was Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> who call'd himſelf <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth; who before his Election was not ſo much as a Biſhop, and ſo was afterwards, but before his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, made one.

                     <p>If this <hi>Sant-Severina</hi> was truely Elected, then could not <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth be a true Pope: and if <hi>Clement</hi> had no right to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no more could <hi>Leo</hi> the Eleventh, the <hi>Conclave</hi> in which he was choſen, being ruled by the Cardinals made by this <hi>Clement,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine of them being preſent, he having created fifty three in all.</p>

And ſo he became Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, whilſt the other three deſervedly loſt it.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch a ſtory as this there goeth on our King <hi>William</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who though he uſed to be guilty in ſelling Church-places, yet one time it ſeems in a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> frolick he croſt the humour; for an Abbey being vacant, two Monks went to him to beg it or buy it, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one to the other; and in thus out-bidding one another, offer'd great ſums.

The truth is, it muſt be ſomething elſe, beſides true Politicks, that prefers the covetous man to Church-dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, becauſe the very Office or Order through him gets an <hi>Odium</hi> amongſt the people.</p>
                     <p>The Learned <hi>Italian</hi> in his Supplication to the Emperour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Popes guiltineſs of <hi>Simony,</hi> concludes the neceſſity of a General Council, to amend and reſtrain theſe enormities: And though he be a ſerious <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> yet he confeſſeth, that upon theſe and ſuchlike faults, the Temporal Princes have good and ſufficient Authority to call ſuch a Council, and earneſtly perſwades the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes to effect it.</p>
                     <p>But experience tells us, that theſe meetings are as terrible to the Pope, as tumults to the Grand Seignior; the latter upon ſight of theſe up-rores, fears his ruine and end not to be far off; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppoſe Councils, eſpecially the latter, do rather take away then give them any juriſdiction, whereby ſuch conventions are both chargeable and troubleſome to them, in the carrying on of their intereſt; and therefore they uſe all their cunning and reaſon to draw ſuch power and thoughts from Temporal Princes, and with a thouſand ſlights will prolong the time: To which purpoſe the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay not amiſs of them.</p>

Ep. 62.</note> Judgement; yet declared that he had fulfill'd his duty, by yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to his commands, and ſo had accordingly publiſhed the Order abroad. But I warrant you <hi>Gregory</hi> the Eighth, and our Modern Popes, would not thus obey the Emperours; and yet they will not ſay, that this <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, an holy Saint in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, in this his obedience and humility was erronious, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fault.</p>
                  <p>In the Emperours Army there was one <hi>Phocas,</hi> a common Captain
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109877:100"/> or <hi>Centurion,</hi> but a moſt cruel and wicked man, who upon a Mutiny in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> made himſelf very active, ſo that they flew into open Rebellion; and in this humour, he plaid his Cards ſo well, that he became the onely Ring-leader (thoſe that were loyal being forced to flee) inſomuch, that they heaved him upon a Shield (an old Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony not onely in Armies, but alſo in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming their Kings) and ſhouted him up for Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Having gone thus far in villany, he proceeds; and to looſe no time, in all haſte marcheth to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and that with ſuch a ſtrength, that the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> (who of late had led a very religious life, having ſent to all places to be pray'd for) was forced to flee, and ſo in a little Bark with his Wife and Children, ſtole out of the City over the Chanel to <hi>Chalcedon</hi> [now call'd <hi>Scutari</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiu]</hi> but being overtaken by <hi>Phocas</hi> his Souldiers, was brought back to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where <hi>Phocas</hi> had the Emperours Children, (which then he had ſeis'd on) murther'd before the Fathers face; the poor <hi>Mauritius</hi> onely repeating that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Juſt art thou, O Lord, and righteous are thy judgements.</hi> And, which was more, the Emperour having there one of his Sons a little Childe, the kinde Nurſe of it, through a ſtrange pitty, love and loyalty, ſtole it away, and put her own Childe in its ſtead to be ſlain. But the Emperour not to be out done in compaſſion, unwilling to allow of ſuch a cruel charity, withſtood the deſign, and ſo had his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Infant murdred before his face, and at laſt was himſelf alſo ſlain; then their heads were cut off, and their bodies expoſed to all manner of contumelies. There were alſo murder'd <hi>Petrus,</hi> Brother to the Emperour, and many of the Loyal Nobility.</p>

And to make the Tragedy compleat, one <hi>Scholaſticus</hi> an Eunuch having ſaved the Empreſs <hi>Conſtantina</hi> [Daughter to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius;</hi> thus a Father-in-law and Predeceſſor to <hi>Maurice]</hi> and her three Daughters, hid them ſecretly in a Church; yet was not this ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily done, but <hi>Phocas</hi> heard of it, and ſent to have them delivered. <hi>Cyricius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> made ſome oppoſition, nor would he yeild them up, till <hi>Phocas</hi> had by Oath ſworn to do to them no violence; which for ſome time he kept, thruſting them into a Monaſtery, but at the years end, had them all four moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly butcher'd.</p>
                  <p>Here we have <hi>Phocas</hi> one of the moſt abſolute Villains in the world: as for <hi>Mauritius,</hi>

                     <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf cannot but give him many commendations; yet he will quickly ſhoot his bolt to finde out the Reaſon of all theſe Judgements againſt him; and all this, becauſe forſooth he would not comply with the liberty of the Church, as they call it, and was not a ſure Friend to <hi>Gregory;</hi> for this is that which he aims at.</p>
                  <p>And now let us ſee how Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> behaved himſelf towards this Villain; he no ſooner hears of this abominable Murther, and how the Tyrant had made himſelf Emperour, but he hath the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Phocas</hi> and his Wife carryed through <hi>Rome</hi> in triumph, with a great many pretty cantings; and then with a great deal of ſtate and glory placed up amongſt the other Emperours.

                     <p>And in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo zealous were the people by the perſwaſion of the Church-men, that in <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where the Imperial Authority moſt reſided, they flew into ſuch open Tumults or Rebellion, that they

                     <p>But for all this, <hi>Leo</hi> kept his Imperial Seat in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and continued in his reſolution againſt Images, and ſo had them pull'd down; nor could <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third, who ſucceeded his Name-ſake, ſtop his proceedings, though by his Cenſures, with the conſent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, he did not onely declare him deprived from the Communion of all Chriſtians, but alſo depoſed from his Empire.

The firſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Majordoms was <hi>Ebroin,</hi> in the time of <hi>Theodorick</hi> or <hi>Thierry</hi> the Firſt, a very meek and patient King. In this Kings raign was alſo <hi>Pepin</hi> the <hi>Groſs,</hi> Major of the Palace: Son to this <hi>Pepin</hi> was <hi>Charles</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Martel,</hi> who had himſelf call'd Prince and Duke of the <hi>French;</hi> and in his Tomb at S. <hi>Denis</hi> he is ſtiled <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <hi>Pepin</hi> agitated by an ambitious humour, reſolves to make himſelf King of <hi>France;</hi> and to facilitate his Treachery, he had ſeveral of his Creatures prompted to ſound nothing but his commendation; and having thus got a good eſteem amongſt the Vulgar, (who love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than novelty) and having alſo gain'd over to his Faction and intereſt, what by former favours, future promiſes, and ſome awe, many of the great ones; he procures an Aſſembly or Parliament to be held at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> by the Prelates and Nobility: for as then the third Eſtate or Commons had no authority in voting, onely the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preferring their complaints.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſembly preſently agreeth to the preferment of <hi>Pepin:</hi> nor was there any thing which lay in the way, but one ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oath of Allegiance they had formerly ſworn to <hi>Childerick.</hi> And if
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109877:106"/> they could be but diſingaged from this, they were then reſolved to pull down their King, and ſet up the little Candidate.</p>

                        <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being dead, his Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Fifth ſucceeded; but being then young, his Mother <hi>Irene</hi> governed all: ſhe was very earneſt for the worſhipping of Images, and (which hugely gratified the Pope of <hi>Rome)</hi> ſhe had the uſe of them confirm'd by a Council at <hi>Nice:</hi> and though ſhe was a woman, and the handſomeſt of her time, yet ſhe wanted neither policie nor courage to ſway the Imperial Scepter; and for that time ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, ſhe was eſteemed by moſt.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Constantine</hi> being now come to years, takes the Government upon himſelf, hath his Mother <hi>Irene</hi> to live by her ſelf, ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his Father and Grand-father had done before, zealous againſt Images, and willing that Prieſts ſhould marry; and commands <hi>Stau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius,</hi> an Infant of his Mothers, not to meddle any more with State-Affairs: though at laſt he let <hi>Irene</hi> have a great hand in the Empire.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe not content, unleſs ſhe had all, conſpires againſt her Son; and with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Stauratius,</hi> won the Army over to their Faction, and ſo violently ſeiſed upon the Emperour, (who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured an eſcape, but could not) whoſe eyes ſhe unnaturally ordered to be pluck'd out; which was acted with ſuch violence upon him, that he dyed preſently after.

                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Lewes</hi> informed of this, imploys his whole care to provide himſelf with a ſufficient force; which having gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſeveral places, marched towards his Enemy. <hi>Bernard</hi> underſtanding the great ſtrength of <hi>Lewes,</hi> and his own Souldiers running away from him, whereby he knowing that he was not able to ſtand againſt him, having conſulted ſeveral ways for his own ſafety, he found none that were probable to ſucceed, but his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and knowing the Emperour of all men to be moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good-natured, taking his opportunity, he goeth to <hi>Lewes,</hi> acknowledgeth his fault, and humbly begs his pardon; and ſo did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the chief of this Rebellion; by which means a full diſcovery of the deſign was made: but that which incenſed moſt, was, that the Emperour by theſe confeſſions underſtood, that ſome of his own chief Councellors, and moſt intimate familiars, were privy to, and ingaged in the Treachery.</p>

                        <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> Nephew to King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> who was ſo famous in thoſe Wars againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> for his great prudence and ſucceſs, that the Emperour <hi>Lewes</hi> took a ſpecial liking to him; and being of ſuch great Birth, and Duke of <hi>Barcenona,</hi> he took him to him into <hi>France,</hi> making him a ſpecial favourite. At this promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Stranger, the <hi>French</hi> took pet; and at laſt, by rumours and falſe news ſo increaſed the charge, that the crime alſo fell heavily upon the Empreſs <hi>Juditha,</hi> as one too familiar with the ſaid <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and as one that had ſo much poſſeſs'd the Emperours affection, that ſhe not onely ruled all, but intended alſo to get all for her Son <hi>Charles,</hi> from the Emperours other three Children.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, theſe reports are by the Wiſeſt held to be falſe and impertinent; for the Emperour, to ſatisfie the world of the firſt, order'd <hi>Bernardo</hi> to depart from him; which accordingly he did, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Spain:</hi> and for any other crime lay'd to him, having beg'd leave, he publickly challenged (according to the cuſtom of thoſe times) any his accuſer, againſt whom he would clear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie by Combat; but none appearing, he purged himſelf by Oath.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Judith, Lewes</hi> for peace-ſake had ſent her into a Nunnery; nor would he receive her again, till before her Enemies ſhe had clear'd her ſelf: And a late judicious <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109877:109"/> pretence, <hi>viz.</hi> the indeavours to have young <hi>Charles</hi> to over-top his Brothers, is very impertinent, conſidering how he had given to one a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> to another a great command in <hi>France;</hi> and the Eldeſt, <hi>viz. Lotharius,</hi> he had had him crown'd Emperour (though himſelf then living) according to the cuſtom of thoſe times, the better to confirm his ſucceſſion in the Empire.</p>
                     <p>But were theſe pretences true, I ſee no Authority to warrant this Rebellion, which all Authors cry out againſt, and acknowledge the cauſe of all, to be meerly Ambition, Arrogancie, with hopes of domineering.</p>
                     <p>To this Rebellion, ſeveral of their proud Prelates had an itching <note place="margin">

The chief of theſe were <hi>Ebo</hi> or <hi>Ebbo,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> at firſt a beggerly fellow, but by the Emperours favour thus prefer'd. <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and ſuch like; and ſome of the chief Nobility were great promoters of this villany, as <hi>Hilduin, Hugo, Monfredus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And who muſt head theſe, but <hi>Pepin</hi> the Emperours Son? and ſo having got a conſiderable Army together, he marcheth againſt his Father, and in his way takes <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour upon notice of this, ſends his Empreſs for ſecurity <note place="margin">Anno. 830.</note> or policie to a Nunnery at <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> himſelf going to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne</hi> neerer <hi>Paris. Pepin</hi> hearing of this, ſends a party of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to <hi>Laon,</hi> where by force they take out <hi>Juditha,</hi> and carry her to their General; where ſhe is threatned with all manner of torments and deaths, unleſs ſhe will uſe all her Arguments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to perſwade <hi>Lewes</hi> to become Monk, and reſign the Empire, and ſhe her ſelf to turn Nun. Upon this, ſhe is carryed to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> where ſhe privately perſwades the Emperour to be as cunning as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in this great concern: and having diſcovered to him ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hints, ſhe returns to the Confederates, by whom ſhe is ſent to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and there thruſt into the Abbey of <note n="a" place="margin">De S. Croix.</note> S. <hi>Radegonde,</hi> and there by force vailed as a Nun: <hi>Pepin,</hi> and his Confederates, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly rejoycing at this fine act of theirs, thinking that now they had all at command, and as heart could wiſh.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Inſolencies were acted in <hi>France, Lotharius</hi> or <hi>Lotaire,</hi> the Eldeſt Brother, was in <hi>Italy</hi> at his command; but that he leaveth, and cometh to be an Actor with the reſt. At his firſt coming in, his Councils were divided; for though he declared againſt any incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be done to his Father, yet he puniſhed all <hi>Don Bernardo</hi>'s Relations he could met withal; one he baniſh'd, and another he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have his eyes pull'd out, and then did as much as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all that had been hitherto done; and ſo the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour remain'd without any Power or Authority, excepting the bare Name.</p>
                     <p>Having gone thus far, 'twas at laſt ſuppoſed the moſt plauſible means to bring their deſigns about, to have a publick Meeting or Aſſembly held; where they did not queſtion, but their actions would be approved of, and the Emperour forced to reſign. Upon this, it behooves <hi>Lewes</hi> to play his Cards well now or never; and having conſulted all ways, at laſt he found none that had any hopes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109877:110"/> of ſecurity, but to truſt to his old Friends the <hi>Germans,</hi> where if he could procure the Aſſembly to be kept, he queſtion'd not but all would go well; for he thought that at this time he had little reaſon to confide in his Country-men the <hi>French,</hi> who had thus in time of ſuch need left him in the lurch.</p>
                     <p>And accordingly he behaved himſelf ſo cunningly, that he not only got the Parliament to be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> but a ſo that none ſhould appear at this meeting in a Warlike poſture, and accompanied with no more than his own Family and Attendants. And having thus ſecured himſelf, he goeth to the place appointed with his Son <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> where ſeeing himſelf ſtrengthned with the affection and aſſiſtance of a great many <hi>Germans,</hi> he pluck'd up his courage, and began to oppoſe the vapours of his Enemies; and in full Parliament, being informed that the two Lord Abbots, <hi>Halduin</hi> and <hi>Walachus,</hi> his main oppoſers, had come to the Meeting attended with Armed men, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask'd them, how they durſt appear ſo accompanyed againſt the Edict? and to puniſh this their inſolencie, commanded both of them with their Souldiers to depart the place, confining the firſt to reſide and winter at <hi>Paderborn</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and the other at <hi>Corbie</hi> in <hi>Picardy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This action quite broke the hearts of the reſt of the Conſpirators, and put them to their wits ends; and ſcarce knowing which way to turn themſelves, the next night, the chief of them went to <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> to conſult what ſhould be done: nor need this take up much time of conſideration; for they found but two ways, either preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put it to the venture of the Sword, or to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Parliament, till they could increaſe their force, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to carry all <hi>France,</hi> which they doubted not of, or by ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to get the Emperour out of the <hi>Germans</hi> protection; but by all means they perſwaded <hi>Lotharius</hi> never to comply with his Father; and having thus vented their wicked counſels, they returned to their Lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Lewes</hi> was not idle all this while, but kept his Spies on foot, by whom he underſtood the deſign of this <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> Upon which, next morning he ſends to his Son <hi>Lothaire,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him not to be rul'd by ſuch wicked counſel; nor to truſt to ſuch falſe Friends, who had rebell'd againſt their Soveraign, and would in time, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lotharius</hi> at laſt thinks it beſt to obey his Fathers good advice, and accordingly goeth to him, where he was accepted with the deareſt affection of a Father. The Conſpirators inform'd of this, knew not what to do; but at laſt thought it beſt to perſwade the Vulgar to Sedition, and ſo preſently gave out that <hi>Lotharius</hi> was ſeis'd upon, cloſely clapt up in priſon, and by the appointment of his inraged Father was preſently to ſuffer, unleſs by violence he were releaſed. The people upon this hurry into Tumults, and ſo in a tumultuous manner reel towards the Palace, breathing forth nothing but deſtruction, and the relief of the ſuppoſed Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and in this fury fall upon the Emperours Life-guard, who loyally and valiantly, for preſervation of their Maſter, defend the Palace-gates, and keep off the inraged Rabble and Confederates. <hi>Lewes</hi> informed of this outrage and danger, reſolved to undeceive
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109877:110"/> them; and taking with him <hi>Lothaire,</hi> ſhew'd themſelves to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Rebels, whom he deſired his Son to ſatisfie and pacifie. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> having commanded ſilence, and obtain'd it, informed the people of their miſtake; and in a large Speech declared the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and amity between his Father and himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The multitude by this means being pacified, the whole deſign of the Faction and Rebellion fell to the ground; by which means <hi>Lewes</hi> obtain'd ſo much courage and authority, that he had the chief of the Confederates ſeis'd upon, and in publick Parliament convicted of high-Treaſon, and ſo condemned to death. But ſuch was the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Emperour, that he onely had the Clergy-men deprived, and ſome of the Laity, for ſecurity ſake, confined to Monaſteries: And as for his Rebellious Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> forgetting all animoſity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into the height of his paternal affection. And having thus eas'd himſelf of one Rebellion, he ſent for his Empreſs <hi>Juditha</hi> from the Abbey of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> whom yet he would not receive to his bed, till according to his Laws, ſhe had purged her ſelf from all the crimes and objections lay'd againſt her. And thus peace being made between him and his Children, he diſſolved the Parliament, ſending his Sons to their reſpective charges, <hi>viz. Lotharius</hi> to <hi>Italy, Pepin</hi> to <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi> to <hi>Bavaria.</hi> But not content with this favour and mercie, to compleat his Charity, after the holy Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was finiſhed, he by a general Act of Oblivion pardoned all thoſe whom he had before puniſhed, deprived or confined, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granting to every man the liberty of departing and injoying what they did formerly, according to their own humours and pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>Now we might ſuppoſe that all would be quiet, the chief of the Rebels, by the Emperours mercie, not onely being ſhamed, but obliged into loyalty: but we ſhall finde the contrary. For the aforeſaid <hi>Bernardo,</hi> having by his intreaty procured ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliament to be held for the publick clearing of himſelf from all accuſations lay'd againſt him; accordingly he came, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the unjuſt and heatheniſh cuſtom of thoſe times, offer'd to prove his innocencie by Combat; but none appearing to fight him, by Oath he publickly prov'd himſelf unguilty. The Emperour to ſatisfie all parties, ſent to his Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> who ſeemed the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, to be preſent at this meeting and purgation of <hi>Bernardo.</hi> But <hi>Pepin</hi> doth not preſently obey, but protracts the time till the Parliament was diſſolved, and all finiſhed; which affront ſo much incens'd <hi>Lewes,</hi> that he commanded <hi>Pepin</hi> to be ſeis'd upon, who at laſt giving his Keepers the ſlip, eſcaped and fled to <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> where (upon what account I know not) he got <hi>Bernardo</hi> to revolt from the Emperour, and joyn with him in the ſame Rebellion: But <hi>Pepin</hi> being ſeis'd upon again, was, to prevent his farther miſchief, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whence he had moſt ſway, and confined to <hi>Trevers</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> but from this reſtraint and judgement he alſo eſcaped; and being at liberty, made it his whole deſign to moleſt and oppoſe his Father, filling all places he could with Inſurrections; which ſo incenſed <hi>Lewes,</hi> that (ſeeing by fair means he could not reclaim his Son) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all juriſdiction over, and to <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe he poſſeſt, giving the ſame to his Sons <hi>Lotharius</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi>

                     <p>The Emperour ſeeing himſelf thus left in the lurch by his perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Army, and ſo neer his Enemies, that there was no hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping, and if he could, knew not whither to go; deſireth his Friends, then left with him, to depart and ſhift for themſelves, that ſo they might avoy'd the fury of their Rebellious Enemies, not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ſhould ſuffer ruine for their fidelity and honeſty: and having thus perſwaded them, with tears and ſighs of both parties they ſtole away. And being thus left onely with his Wife, his young Son <hi>Charles,</hi> and a few Servants, he ſent to his Rebellious Sons, that he would deliver himſelf into their hands; provided they would take care that no affront or violence ſhould be done to him, and thoſe few with him: the Sons conſent to it, and command him to come to them; who forthwith mounting on Horſe-back, with his few Friends, rode to their Camp, where the Empreſs was taken from him, delivered to his Son <hi>Lewes,</hi> and by him ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there thruſt into a Nunnery at <hi>Tortona,</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Milan;</hi> and the Emperour with the reſt of his Companions were alſo confin'd: And now they parted all amongſt them, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves; <hi>Pepin</hi> was reſtored to <hi>Aquitaine; Lewes</hi> had <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with ſome other Additions; and <hi>Lothaire</hi> poſſeſt the Empire, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109877:111"/> moſt of <hi>France;</hi> and ſo the other Brothers departed to their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lothaire</hi> had his Father in his cuſtody, whom he carryed to <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and there thruſt him into the Abbey of St. <hi>Medard,</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles</hi> into another Monaſtery; and having appointed a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament (for the better colour to his Rebellion) to be held at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne,</hi> at the time appointed they met, where the condition of the Emperour was conſidered, a company of lying accuſations brought in againſt him, invented crimes falſely lay'd to his charge, and what not? to make him odious to the people. <hi>Hebo,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> and other Prelates (the Ring-leaders of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion) ſpoke and acted furiouſly againſt him. In the mean time they ſent to him, to ſee if he would quietly and freely reſign the Empire, which he abſolutely refuſed to do, declaring he would never part with his Authority; proteſting againſt them as no Judges over him, he being their Soveraign, and they onely his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But this put not the leaſt ſtop to their villany; on the contrary, rather increaſing their inſolencie: and ſo in a formal way (like our bloudy High-Court of Juſtice) proceeding againſt him; whom, though not heard, nor permitted to approach or ſpeak for himſelf, they adjudged not worthy to Rule; and by their pretended autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, did there deprive him of all Right, Power, Juriſdiction, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he had to the Diadem; and ſo adjudged him to a Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life, never to meddle hereafter in any Buſineſs. Nor was this all, but, that the Action might carry the greater ſhew of Equity with it, they by ſome falſe Friends had ſo cunningly dealt with the Emperor underhand, that for all his former reſolution, for peace-ſake he was over-perſwaded or threatned to confeſs himſelf guilty, and that in the moſt publick and vileſt faſhion, to procure to themſelves the greateſt honour with the people, and moſt ignominy to himſelf. And the manner was thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewes</hi> was carryed to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> and then in the great Church of the Bleſſed Virgin, before the Parliament and People, he kneel'd down upon an Hair-cloth, and did publickly confeſs before them all, that he had done many things amiſs, whilſt he ſway'd the Scepter: But this they thought not ſufficient, and therefore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops commanded him to make a farther and fuller acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his crimes and offences; to which purpoſe, they had afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand drawn up a large writing, of a great company of ſins, abuſes and enormities, of all which he was there declared guilty.

                     <p>This ſlanderous Paper being given into the Emperours hand, he was made to read it before them with a loud voice, and with trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tears, to acknowledge himſelf guilty of all thoſe untruths; which done, the Prelates ſubſcribed their names as Witneſſes; and for a farther confirmation of it, 'twas then lay'd upon the High Altar, as a full and compleat Teſtimony againſt <hi>Lewes.</hi> Yet did not all this ſatisfie, for as yet the Emperour had not been diſpoſſeſt of his Imperial Badges; and ſo to finiſh their malice, firſt, they make him take off his Sword and Belt, both which were laid alſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109877:112"/> upon the Altar; then the Biſhops pull off his other Royal Robes, inſtead of which, firſt they put on him an Hair-ſhirt, then the other Weeds belonging to a Monk; ſo Maſs being ended, the people are diſmiſt, and poor <hi>Lewes</hi> thruſt into a Monaſtery, whence the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being diſſolved, <hi>Lotharius</hi> leads him in that pittiful habit and condition to <hi>Aken</hi> (or <hi>Aix)</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here have we ſeen a good, pious, and virtuous Emperour brought to the worſt of ignominies, by his own Rebellious Sons and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and now his unnatural Childe <hi>Lothaire</hi> ruled and ſway'd all according to his own pleaſure, which ſtir'd up diſcontent in many, whilſt the patience of the holy <hi>Lewes,</hi> at the long run, moved pitty and compaſſion in others. But not to dwell on this ſorrowful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject too long: to be ſhort, ſeveral conſult ſeriouſly about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reſolve to be eas'd from their bondage, determine the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Lewes;</hi> to which purpoſe after ſome conſideration, ſome Grandees levy men, which at laſt, increaſe to a conſiderable ſtrength, and ſo ſend to <hi>Lotharius</hi> to have his Father reſtored; who reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That none can grieve more than he for the hard dealings againſt his Father; but he being depoſed by the Decree of the Biſhops, he cannot be reſtored without their conſent; and deſires the preſence of ſome of thoſe Gentlemen to conſult with him. In the mean time he had departed from <hi>Germany,</hi> carrying his Father Priſoner with him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and thence to S. <hi>Denis.</hi> But perceiving himſelf not able to cope with his Enemies, who came too ſuddenly upon him, he withdrew into <hi>Burgondy,</hi> leaving his Father behinde him. In the mean time, thoſe who intended the Reſtauration of the Emperour, came to S. <hi>Denis,</hi> releaſe <hi>Lewes;</hi> to whom they offer their ſervice, and deſire him to take upon him the Empire again. This he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, unleſs he were declared innocent, and reſtored by Biſhops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by them he had formerly been deprived. Upon this ſome Biſhops are got, who in the great Church at S. <hi>Denis,</hi> declare the former ſentence illegal, with their own hands take off him his Monkiſh Attire, inveſt him with the Soveraign Purple, gird his Sword and Belt to him again; and all this publickly before the people. And ſo we have him Emperour once again.</p>
                     <p>But his Son <hi>Lotharius</hi> was far from ſubmitting to, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any legality in this action; and ſo having got a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army, he ruineth all before him, making <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>Dauphinè,</hi> and other places there, ſubmit to him; thence he returneth into <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy,</hi> where he taketh <hi>Chalons</hi> upon the great River <hi>Soane,</hi> which he deſtroyeth, and he headeth the two loyal Noblemen, <hi>Goſſelinus</hi> [or <hi>Gotſelin]</hi> and <hi>Sanila</hi> [or <hi>Samila]</hi> and to highten his cruelty and Rebellion, takes the Lady <hi>Gerberg</hi> out of a Nunnery where ſhe profeſt, made her be put into a Wine-veſſel, and ſo thrown into the River <hi>Soane,</hi> where ſhe was drown'd; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hence proceeded in his fury to other places in <hi>France.</hi> But the patient Emperour ſent to his Son <hi>Lothaire</hi> a pardon, and took him into his favour again; the Son being the more willing to accept of it, becauſe he now found that he was not able to withſtand his Father.</p>
                     <p>And now we might think again that all would be quiet, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many pardonings and favours, they would let the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour live in peace. But we finde quite contrary; for his Son <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> troubles him again in <hi>Italy:</hi> but this being pacified, his youngeſt Son <hi>Lewes</hi> rais'd forces and rebell'd in <hi>Germany;</hi> the news
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109877:112"/> of which being brought to the good Emperour, ſo hugely troubled and perplext him, that it put him into a diſeaſe, which never left him till his dying day, which followed not long after; all which <note place="margin">Anno 840.</note> would be too tedious here to relate, the former action being ſatisfactory enough to any man, of the heinouſneſs of theſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rebellions.</p>
                     <p>We have formerly hinted of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourth, coming from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> in the time of theſe late Rebellions; and how by his means, time was protracted at <hi>Lugenfeldt,</hi> to the ruine of the Emperours Cauſe, and his Dethronization: To which I ſhall add nothing, but onely this by the by, that ſome will not at all grant, that the Pope himſelf had any deſign againſt <hi>Lewes,</hi> but meerly came upon a good intent to make peace amongſt them: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Objection I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with a Reply, but onely refer the Readers to the Learned Collections of <note n="a" place="margin">De rebus ſeculi I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However it be, 'tis confeſt by all parties, that in <hi>France</hi> the Pope left a very ill name behinde him, for his too much (as they thought) compliance with the Sons.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, the Emperour might very well take ſome diſtaſte againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> for that noted ſedition there; in which <hi>Theodore,</hi> chief Secretary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> had their Eyes pull'd out, and Noſes cut off, and ſo ſlain in the <hi>Lateran</hi> it ſelf; and no one crime objected againſt them, but their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Emperour: Of which action Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> the Firſt was accuſed by ſome; but he indeavour'd by his Agents to clear himſelf of this crime to the Emperour: but this not ſatisfying, and ſeeing <hi>Lewes</hi> farther reſolved to finde out the buſineſs, he by his own Oath declared himſelf guiltleſs; and yet at the ſame time ſo ſtout was <hi>Paſchal,</hi> that he would not permit thoſe who had ſlain them to be puniſhed, or to fall under any ſecular Judge; and the reaſon of all this was, becauſe they were people that belong'd to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> A pretty <hi>Maxime;</hi> yet were it worſe, it would be authentick enough in that houſhold.

                     <p>'Tis true, Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> did alſo declare thoſe who were ſlain to be guilty of death, and that they juſtly ſuffer'd; but this was ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfactory to <hi>Lewes,</hi> that he ſent ſome again to <hi>Rome</hi> to examine and try the buſineſs: but the death of the Pope, in the mean time, render'd that Journey uſeleſs.

                        <hi>Congnard.</hi> As for my own judgement, I ſhall wrap it up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality or paſſion in this, that I am ſo far from being ſatisfied with the reaſons brought againſt the being of ſuch a woman Pope, that I may fancie thoſe who aſſert a Pope <hi>Joane,</hi> afford better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Teſtimony, and Arguments, than thoſe who deny it: And as <hi>Cooke</hi> in Engliſh hath ſufficiently anſwered <hi>Floromondus</hi> and the reſt, ſo doth <hi>Mariſius</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>Congnard</hi> in <hi>French</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly confute <hi>David Blondel,</hi> though a man of great read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But be it this way or that way, it ſhall never trouble me; and ſo let every man think as he pleaſeth, for ſo they muſt and will: Nor do I poſitively determine any thing here my ſelf. And ſo much for our Pope or No-Pope <hi>Joane,</hi> a ſtory that hath drawn forth to open <hi>Battalia,</hi> and ſiding, the greateſt Pens in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſome
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109877:113"/> to vindicate, others to annihilate the ſitting of ſuch a Lady in the Porphyrie Chair, as Infallible Head of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church: nor to this day will either party give ground or yeild, but ſtill fight it out; and which is more, both ſinging <hi>Victoria,</hi> and triumphing as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours: and thus it hath the happineſs or misfortune to fare, as ſome other Articles of the greateſt conſequence in Religion, never to want Friends and Enemies</p>
                     <p>Thus have we ſeen the pious and victorious Emperour, <hi>Lewes le Debonnaire,</hi> miſerably banded to and fro by his own unnatural Children and rebellious Subjects, and by the conſent of the chief of his Clergy [and thoſe too, as Hiſtorians obſerve, whom himſelf or his Great Father had rais'd and prefer'd from the meaneſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to theſe chiefeſt places of Honour and Riches] uſed with all manner of reproach, villany, and ignominy; yet they farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſevere judgements fell upon the chief of them, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">

And as for the ſons themſelves [except <hi>Pepin,</hi> who dyed whilſt his Father lived] after the deceaſe of the Emperour <hi>Lewes,</hi> we may finde them all together by the ears, proſecuting one another with all manner of violence and fury.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall conclude this Tragical ſtory of good <hi>Lewes</hi> with his Epitaph, as it is in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Arnulf</hi> at <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> which is according to the riming faſhion of thoſe times; by which we may judge the height of their Wit and Poetry: for 'tis to be ſuppos'd that ſuch a great Emperour had none of the worſt Poets of thoſe days to celebrate his fame and memory thus upon his Tomb [and yet we have had many worſe made ſince upon other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings.]</p>

Thus ſtagger'd the Temporal Juriſdiction; the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs themſelves, either by eaſineſs, or bad counſellors, neglecting their own Authority; and ſometimes led by a zealous fear, other times by policie, or intereſt, were willing to think, and eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Pope had a greater power than St. <hi>Peter</hi> ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, or any of his ancienter and honeſter Predeceſſors ever thought they had, in relation to a Coercive Authority over Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes. And what they have once got or made, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe [right or wrong:] for the firſt they will never part with; and the ſecond, they will make an Article of Faith.</p>
                     <p>And the truth of this may be teſtified by approved Hiſtory. The Emperour <hi>Lewes</hi> the Second (of whom we formerly hinted) dying without Sons, a diſpute aroſe about the Succeſſion: but <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> obtain'd it of Pope <hi>John</hi> the Ninth, as ſome call him, and that, as ſome ſay, according to the confeſſion of their <note n="a" place="margin">Vite di gl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Imperadori, fol. 326. b.</note> 
                        <hi>Mexia,</hi> by gifts and Bribery: But after this, <hi>Charles le Chaune</hi> being <note n="b" place="margin">An. 877.</note> poy ſoned at <hi>Mantoa,</hi> by his Phyſitian <hi>Zedechias</hi> a Jew, the canvas began again.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>John</hi> was reſolved for <hi>Lewes</hi> the Third, King of <hi>France;</hi> but many of the <hi>Italians</hi> were for <hi>Charles</hi> the Fat of <hi>Germany:</hi> and in this reſolution both parties were ſo ſtubborn, that the chief of the <hi>Romans</hi> took Arms, ſeis'd upon the Pope, and impriſoned him; from whence he getting free, fled into <hi>France,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd the <note n="c" place="margin">An. 878.</note> Empire upon <hi>Lewes</hi> the Third, the <note n="d" place="margin">Balbus, le Begue.</note> Stammerer or Stutterer. But this humour laſteth not long; for a little after, the Pope being aſſiſted by <hi>Charles</hi> againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> then invading <hi>Italy,</hi> diſanull'd the Coronation of the ſaid <hi>Lewes</hi> the Third, and declared and Crown'd for <note n="e" place="margin">An. 880.</note> Emperour this <hi>Charles,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Groſſe</hi> or <hi>Fat.</hi> Though I wonder what honeſt man gave the Pope this power or right of diſpoſing Kingdoms. But as the Proverb ſaith of Dogs, we may juſtly affirm, that whilſt two ſtrive for a Temporal Title, the Pope is ſure to gain, if not the Thing, yet the eſteem or honour to diſpoſe of it, a fooliſh Zeal or Intereſt being the conveyers.</p>
                     <p>Yet was the end of this <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fat</hi> deplorable enough; for having been Emperour eight years, and by reaſon of his exceſſive fatneſs, growing very dull and lazie, he was <note n="f" place="margin">An. 887.</note> forſaken by all his Subjects; who having cunningly order'd their plots, elected into the Government <hi>Arnulph</hi> his Nephew, baſtard to <hi>Carloman,</hi> Son to <hi>Lewes</hi> the Second. Thus was <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Groſs,</hi> one of the greateſt ſway then in the world, being Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and other Territories, ſuddenly thrown down from his Glory: and though a man <note n="g" place="margin">

                     <p>THe depoſing and death of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fat</hi> being known, the Empire fell out into great diviſions; for the <hi>Italians</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly began to grumble, that the Emperours, for ſo long time, had not been elected within their Country, affirming <hi>Italy</hi> to be the true Seat of the Empire: On the contrary, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſtood as ſtiff for their ſoyl, declaring that by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the Empire was tranſlated thither, and there it muſt remain; and ſo accordingly they chuſe <hi>Arnolph</hi> for Emperonr, and acknowledge none other. In the mean time, the Popes (now alſo divided into Factions) and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> crown other men for Emperours; and ſo for almoſt LXXX years did each Nation live under their reſpective Emperors or Kings. And to this day, ſo reſolved are moſt of the Writers of both Countries, that the <hi>Germans</hi> acknowledge none for Emperours, but who were choſen in their Country; whom, on the other ſide, the <hi>Italians</hi> reject as onely inferiour perſons, and write onely thoſe to be <hi>Caeſars,</hi> who were elected on their ſide the Alpes. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Baronius</hi> is very zealous for his Popes and Country <hi>(viz. Italy)</hi> daſhing out all along thoſe of the <hi>German</hi> Elections; for which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he gives you this thundring reaſon, <note n="b" place="margin">Eo quod nefas eſſet Imperatoris nomen aſſumere, niſi illud eſſet ab Apoſtolica ſede collatum. <hi>Baron.</hi> an. 887. § 3.</note>

                     <p>It chanced that King <hi>Edward</hi> hunting in the Iſland <hi>Purbeck</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire,</hi> either by chance or deſign was ſeparated from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and perceiving himſelf neer <hi>Corfe</hi>-Caſtle, where his Mother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law <hi>Elfrida,</hi> and her ſon <hi>Ethelred</hi> then lived, to both which perſons he bare a great affection; he reſolved to go ſee them, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rides up to the Gate. His Stepdame comes to him with a cheerful countenance, ſeeming very glad of his viſit and kindneſs, and deſired him to alight; but this he excuſed, pleading haſte, and that he onely ſlipt from his company at that time, and then to his company again, juſt to ſee her, and his Brother; and ſo deſired a cup of Wine to drink to them, who might be troubled by a long miſſing of him, they not knowing the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>She perceiving that ſhe could not bring her deſigns about within doors, reſolves to do it without: ſo ſhe appointed one of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſtab him there. To be ſhort, Wine is brought, given him; and he no ſooner had the cup at his mouth, but the fellow ſtruck him with a knife into the back. The King perceiving himſelf ſore wounded, ſet ſpurs to his Horſe, thinking to gallop away, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, to his more faithful Friends; but the wounds being great, and he fainting through loſs of blood, fell from his horſe, one of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109877:126"/> his feet being intangled in the Stirrop, by reaſon whereof his Horſe drag'd him up and down through Woods and Lands: And thus was that good King <hi>Edward</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">An. 979.</note> murder'd, and was ſirnamed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; though <note n="b" place="margin">Hiſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. p. 188. in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note>

                     <p>After this murther, they go on, and tell a great many ſtories of him; as how his Step-mother <hi>Elfritha</hi> (for ſo ſome call her) had his body drag'd into a little houſe hard by, and there cover'd over with ſtraw for the preſent neceſſity, that it might not be found; <note place="margin">

                        </note> but a poor woman, who was born blind living there, by miracle had that night her ſight given her: <hi>Elfrida</hi> troubled at this, fearing that by this diſcovery the body might be found, had it taken thence and thrown into the Mariſhes: but this would not do neither; for a year after God reveal'd to ſome men that the body was in thoſe Waters; but the certain place could not be found out, till a fiery Pillar was pleas'd to point them to it, whence it was carryed and buryed at <hi>Warham,</hi> and having laid there ſome years uncorrupted, 'twas thence with great ſolemnity tranſlated to <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> neer the borders of <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here might I tell the ſtrange Miracles wrought by the vertue of this holy <hi>Edward,</hi> of blind receiving ſight, deaf hearing, the lame and ſick their limbs and health; but that I cannot oblige the Readers belief. As for the murthering <hi>Elfrida,</hi> although, they ſay, that at firſt ſhe was puniſhed by Miracles, as deſiring to ſee the Tomb of her Son-in-law, the Horſe on which he rode would by no means carry her thither; and though ſhe tryed ſeveral, yet we finde all commanded by the ſame ſtubbornneſs, which making her more keen, ſhe reſolved to go on foot; yet though her will was never ſo ſtrong, they ſay, ſhe could not poſſibly do it. However, at laſt, we need not queſtion <hi>Elfrida</hi>'s Religion and pardon, ſince to quit and expiate her from the guilt of this horrid murther, ſhe built two Nunneries, <note n="c" place="margin">Ambreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> 
                        <hi>Almesbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and <hi>Warwell</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> An eaſie way of recompence for rich people, to eaſe themſelves of the moſt crying ſins: And though I am not obliged either to cenſure one, or vindicate the other; yet ſome may juſtly fancie, that ſeveral of thoſe ancient buildings being thus founded upon blood and rapine, might as by a judgement call a deſtroying hand upon them. But far be it from me to oppoſe Monuments of Charity, which without queſtion may hugely advance the glory of God upon Earth, and ſmooth the Founders way to Heaven: And I could wiſh that thoſe ancient Monuments of Piety (for without doubt many of them were really ſo) nobly ſpread about by our Fore-fathers liberality, had either continued as good Examples, or been better imploy'd at their Diſſolutions. But this by the way.</p>

                     <p>After him ſucceeded <hi>Indulph,</hi> who in battle having beaten the <hi>Danes,</hi> through miſtake chanced amongſt ſome of them, and was ſlain; and then was <note n="d" place="margin">An. 962.</note> 
                        <hi>Duffe</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all Thieves and Vagabonds, and made all people that had nothing to live on, to learn ſome Trade, that by their rapine and villanies, they might not oppreſs the Commons and honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. This amongſt the wicked got him a great many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and, which might ſeem more ſtrange, ſeveral of the Nobles alſo hated him, becauſe thus they were kept from their Tyranny and Oppreſſion; many of their younger Sons having little to live upon, but theſe villanies; and moſt of them grumbled that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, forſooth, ſhould thus be hindred from rapine, and forced to get their livings by honeſt Imployments. But the chief murmuring was in <hi>Murreyland,</hi> who at laſt fell from words to blows, and ſlew the Kings Officers.</p>
                     <p>And that which moſt imbolden'd them to theſe Rebellions, was their knowledge of the Kings grievous ſickneſs, whereby himſelf was diſabled from proſecuting them; nor indeed would his Phyſitians let him know of their inſolencies, leſt trouble and perplexity might haſten his end.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diſeaſe it ſelf, I ſhall not determine any thing; but becauſe the ſtory of it is ſomewhat ſtrange and unuſual to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'd in Chronicles, take it as I finde it in <hi>Hector Boetius, Holinſhed,</hi> and ſome other Hiſtorians, upon whoſe credit let the truth of the ſtory lye.</p>
                     <p>The Nobles of <hi>Murreyland</hi> being, as aforeſaid, incenſed againſt the good King, imploy'd Witches to bewitch the King to death. The King falls ſick, and that into ſuch a languiſhing Diſeaſe, that his Phyſitians could not tell what to make of it, ſo that all their Skill and Medicines was to ſmall purpoſe. At laſt, no man knoweth how, or by whom, a report and rumour went amongſt the people that the King was bewitch'd, and that by ſome of the Town call'd <hi>Forres</hi> in <hi>Murrey:</hi> In which Town was a Caſtle, the Captain of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109877:127"/> which was one <hi>Donwald,</hi> who had been faithful to the King amongſt the Rebels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Duffe</hi> informed of this flying rumour of Witches, ſends ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Donald</hi> to inquire out the buſineſs: It chanced that one of the Souldiers of the Caſtle kept a young Wench of the Town as his Lemmon; which being Daughter to one of the Witches, knew their actions, and in part diſcovered it to the Souldier, who upon this inquiry told it to <hi>Donald;</hi> who ſending for the Wench, then in the Caſtle, made her by threats, and other means, confeſs all ſhe knew: whereupon, learning by her in what houſe theſe actions were done, he ſent ſome Souldiers forth about midnight, who breaking into the houſe, found the Witches roaſting by a gentle fire an Image of Wax, reſembling the King, made, as they thought, by the Devil; and by it a Woman ſate reciting certain words of Inchantment, baſting the Image with a certain liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Souldiers upon this ſeis'd upon them, and with the Image led them to the Caſtle; where, upon examination they confeſt, that their deſign was to make away the King: That the Nobles in <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyland</hi> had hired them to do it: That as the Image waſted, ſo would the King: That their canting words kept them from ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon this, the ſtanders by immediately broak the Image of the King, and had the Witches burnt to death; and 'tis ſaid, that at the ſame time, the King was delivered from languor, and ſhortly reſtored to preſent health again. But however the ſtory be, no ſooner was the King well again, but he marched into <hi>Murrey</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rebels, whom he forced to flee: as for them whom he took, he had them hang'd up, without reſpect of perſon or quality.</p>
                     <p>But if witchcraft fail in the Kings deſtruction, his own intimates under the viſage of friendſhip will bring it about. In this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <hi>Donwald</hi> or <hi>Donaeld</hi> had ſome of his own Relations, for whom he beg'd his Majeſties pardon, but 'twas denyed, and ſo they with the reſt were executed; which moved a great diſcontent in <hi>Donald,</hi> which boyld in him ſo much, that his Wife perceived him troubled, nor would ſhe let him alone till ſhe underſtood the cauſe of his diſpleaſure: ſhe added fuel to his malice, and ſo thruſt him on to revenge, that he was willing to make the King away; which, at laſt, by her evil perſwaſions, he reſolves on; which was eaſie enough for them to accompliſh, the King putting ſo great a confidence in <hi>Donald,</hi> that when he was in thoſe parts, he uſed to lye in the ſaid Caſtle of <hi>Forres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At laſt they laid the plot, and pitch'd upon the night; which coming, and the King being in the Caſtle, they made all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. At the ſame night, the King ſuſpecting nothing, thank'd all thoſe who had aſſiſted him againſt the Rebels, and gave them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gifts; and amongſt the reſt <hi>Donald</hi> was one: But for all this reward, he proceeds in his wicked deſign. And that night two of his Chamberlains having got him to bed, left him there, and went to <hi>Donald</hi> and his Wife, who had provided a noble Collation for them, where they plyed their cups ſo well, that being drunk, they were carryed to reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Donald</hi> having thus made all ſecure, call'd four of his Servants, whom before he had fee'd to this wickedneſs, who ſecretly enter the Kings Chamber, <note n="a" place="margin">An. 966.</note> cut his throat, convey'd the body out of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109877:128"/> the Caſtle by a Poſtern-gate, threw it upon an Horſe provided for that purpoſe; but whither they carryed it, Authors do not agree.</p>
                     <p>The common opinion is, that they carryed it two Miles from the Caſtle, where being a little Brook, they got certain Labourers to turn the Courſe of it; then dig a deep hole in the Channel, in which they buryed the body, ramming it up ſo cloſely with ſtones and gravel, that turning the water again into its right courſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of digging was perceived: And this, they ſay, they did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vulgar opinion, leſt the body being found, the Murderer might be diſcovered by its bleeding at their preſence. As for the Labourers whom they gat to turn the water, no ſooner was the work finiſhed, but they ſlew them, leſt they ſhould tell tales; and then the four Villains fled into <hi>Orkny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Buchanan</hi> rejects this ſtory as improbable, but rather that they buryed it in ſome obſcure place under a Bridge, which might be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over with Turf, to hinder the appearance of their freſh delvings.

                     <p>As for <hi>Donald,</hi> to prevent ſuſpition, about the time of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he went amongſt thoſe who kept the watch, as he had been careful of the Kings preſervation, and there he continued till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when noiſe was raiſed that the King was murder'd, and his body not to be found (for they had taken ſpecial care that no bloud ſhould be ſeen out of the Chamber; but his bed was all bloudy) he, as if amazed, and ignorant. of ſuch a thing, ran ſuddenly to the Chamber, where finding the Chamberlains he ſlew them, as guilty of that heinous murther; and running up and down every place, as if to diſcover, finding the Poſtern-gate open, he threw the fault upon the Chamberlains, whom before he had ſlain, affirming them to have had the Keys of the Gates committed to their keeping all that night: And the truth is, he made himſelf ſo ſtrangely buſie in the diſcovery, that ſeveral began to miſtruſt him, though at that time they durſt not ſpeak of it.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:109877:128"/> negligence, which made the Nobles reſolve to depoſe him; to which purpoſe they ſummoned a Parliament at <hi>Scone</hi> (the place where the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kings were Crown'd:) <hi>Culene</hi> informed of this, and knowing himſelf not ſtrong enough to oppoſe, reſolves to go thither alſo; but being on his journey, he was <note n="a" place="margin">An. 971.</note> murder'd at <hi>Meffen</hi>-Caſtle, by one <hi>Radard</hi> or <hi>Cadhard,</hi> Lord or Governour thereof, whoſe Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King had raviſhed.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Murther, <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third is King at <hi>Scone,</hi> one huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended for all manner of Kingly vertues; nor had he any thing to blemiſh that great Reputation he had juſtly deſerved and got, but one wicked crime, <hi>viz.</hi> the poyſoning of his Couſin <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cumberland;</hi> which heinous fault, though no man ſuſpected him, yet his own Conſcience accuſing him, he confeſt it himſelf, and did really repent of that crime. But leaving this, let us ſee the manner of his end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cruthnet,</hi> Son to <hi>Fenella</hi> (of whom hereafter) the Chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Merres,</hi> having been the occaſion of great troubles, fewds and murders, was at laſt with his Companions taken, whom with the other chief Actors were executed by the Kings command; the poorer ſort, as a people ignorant and miſled, were pardoned, and let go to their reſpective habitations; which Juſtice and Mercy was much commended in his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>It chanced that the King having been at <hi>Fordon,</hi> a Town in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> to viſit the Reliques of St. <hi>Palladius</hi> (a holy <hi>Grecian,</hi> who came into <hi>Scotland</hi> about the year 431) which, they ſay, lay here in a little Church, to this day corruptly call'd from him <hi>Padi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lady of this Caſtle was the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Fenalla,</hi> or <hi>Finabella,</hi> as ſome call her, who received the King with a great deal of ſeeming kindneſs and nobleneſs.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſhe reſolved upon his Murther, being incenſed againſt the King, for executing her Son <hi>Cruthnet;</hi> and what ſhe intended, ſhe brought to paſs, but by what means I cannot poſitively conclude. Some there are that tell a pretty ſtory of rare inventions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances to intice the King to his own ruine; as, that ſhe knowing the King to delight much in buildings and rare curioſities, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a place in the Caſtle richly hung with Tapeſtry and rich Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras; and in it a noble braſen Image, holding in one of his hands a fair golden Apple, ſet full of precious Stones: all which was framed with that Art and Cunning, that if any one took the Apple out of its hand, ſeveral Arrows from artificial Croſs-bows placed ſo cunningly, would fly out and kill him. The King after dinner was led into this Chamber by <hi>Fenella: Kenneth</hi> was preſently delighted with the glorious Furniture, but above all with the Image; and asking the meaning of it, was anſwer'd by the Lady, that that rich Apple was placed there, as a poor gift, for himſelf. At length, after ſome looking and admiration, he went to remove the Apple, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Croſs-bows diſcharged their Darts, by which the King was <note n="b" place="margin">An. 994.</note> kill'd.</p>
                     <p>This ſtory, though related by ſeveral old Chronicles, <hi>George Buchanan</hi> doth not think worthy of belief; nor indeed is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſuch great riches as their ſtories here ſpeak of, ſuch Art and ſuch Workmanſhip, ſhould meet together under the power of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109877:129"/> ſuch a Lady, in ſuch a part of the World, ſo long ago, and in ſuch a little while. Whereupon he rather agrees with ſome other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he was murther'd by four Horſe-men, laid purpoſely for that wickedneſs in ambuſh, by the ſaid <hi>Finabella;</hi> and his body was afterwards buryed at <hi>Colmkill.</hi>

And having raigned ſeveral years with great prudence and liberality; at
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109877:130"/> laſt, in his old age he grew very covetous (a vice commonly incident to ſuch doting years:) upon which, ſeveral conſpired againſt him; and being at <hi>Glammys</hi> in <hi>Anguis,</hi> ſeveral of the Plotters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into his Lodging, by his own faithleſs ſervants, where they murder'd him.

                     <p>This is the common opinion; others tell it another way; yet all agree that he was Murther'd.</p>
                     <p>The next that ſucceeded in <hi>Scotland</hi> was <hi>Duncan,</hi> who having raigned a few years, was <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1040.</note> murder'd at <hi>Ennerneſs</hi> by one <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who ſeiſed upon the Kingdom, and was Crown'd at <hi>Scone;</hi> and having Governed ſeventeen years, was alſo <note n="b" place="margin">An. 1057.</note> ſlain by one <hi>Mackduff.</hi>

And that <hi>Mackbeth</hi> was told that he ſhould not be ſlain, till <hi>Birname</hi>-Wood ſhould be brought to <hi>Dunſinan</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Perth ſhire;</hi> nor by a man that was born of a woman. And how that King <hi>Malcolme</hi> the Third fulfill'd the firſt, by making every one of his Souldiers carry a bough of that Wood to the Caſtle; and how <hi>Makduff</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the latter, by being ript out of his Mothers belly, and killing of <hi>Mackbeth.</hi> But I ſhall leave ſuch Tales as theſe to the Miracle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers; which being as pretty as moſt they make uſe of, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel <hi>Baronius</hi> (who, upon every occaſion ſtuffs up his Voluminous Annals with ſuch thwacking wonders) paſſeth by this jeſt in ſilence.

And what muſt be the foundation of his crime, but becauſe the Emperour had an intereſt in his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? though if this Argument will hold any water, they will quite break to pieces the Line of their Succeſſion, by throwing aſide many Popes formerly elected or confirmed by Emperours, and other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Potentates. But fight Dog, fight Bear, I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to reconcile them.</p>
                     <p>Yet though they now ſeem ſo dapperly againſt the Temporal Authority, it is not unworth the notice, that no ſooner was this <hi>Damaſus</hi> (firſt call'd <hi>Poppo)</hi> dead, but the Cardinals, and other <hi>Romans,</hi> ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> to the Emperour, to deſire him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

                     <p>And this practice will better appear by the next Vicar; for no <note place="margin">Platina.</note> ſooner was <hi>Leo</hi> dead, but the Clergy, and others of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent <hi>Hildebrand</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> to the Emperour, to deſire him to give <note place="margin">

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The troubles and depoſing of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, by the pride of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, and other Incendiaries.</head>
                  <p>SHould I trouble my ſelf to reconcile all the exceptions that might belong to this Chapter, I ſhould be Voluminous to a wonder, and poſſibly not ſatisfie the Reader. But to leave ſuch Diſputes, in ſhort, the queſtion is betwixt the Emperour <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh; which of them was in the right, and which to blame: though one may affirm without offence, that both of them had their faults; yet <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> (and from him of late Father <note n="a" place="margin">Remonſt. <hi>Hybern.</hi> part 2. p. 89, 90, &amp;c. part 5. p. 1, 2, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Caron)</hi> hath taken a great deal of pains to vindicate the Emperour, whilſt <hi>Gretſerus</hi> is as large in his ſeveral Apologies for the Pope; whither I ſhall refer the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for farther ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>And it was no ſmall miſery to Chriſtendom, that the Emperour being very young, the Popes acted what they pleas'd without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; though at laſt they drive on ſo furiouſly, that inſtead of making the Empire happy by tranquillity, they procured its ruine by fomenting new troubles and rebellions. For, whereas formerly the Emperours had the main hand in making Popes, and the power of nominating Biſhops in his own Territories, whom he left to be Conſecrated by others; Now, on the contrary, the Pope would take all power into his own hands, allowing no man to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, of what Country ſoever, but whom he pleas'd; by which means he would wreſt all favours from the Temporal juriſdiction to himſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Canon-law</hi> it ſelf grants them ſome favour in this caſe; Now the Pope proceeds ſeverely againſt the married Clergy by Excommunication; and ſo in a manner deprived them of their Beings; which was the cauſe of great troubles in <hi>Germany.</hi> Nor was this all, but alſo <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh thruſt himſelf up above all Dominions and Authorities in the world, by the aſſiſtance of a puny Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> thus declaring his Prerogative,—<hi>viz.</hi>—</p>

                  <p>Thus by little and little did the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops dwindle the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Authority to nothing, by making themſelves ſo great and powerful. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Second had null'd all Lay-Patronage, by making it unlawful to receive any Benefice from a ſecular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which then they call'd <hi>Simony</hi> (though gave <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the Sixth, mainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this way of nominating or deſigning Biſhops by a <hi>Paſtoral Staff</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> by the Temporal Prince, whereby the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops might with more Authority, and leſs prejudice, Conſecrate him; and that this had alſo <note n="e" place="margin">

                  <p>Suchlike actions as theſe procured ſome heart-burnings betwixt the Emperour and Popes, which at laſt fell to open diviſions and animoſity; to which the troubleſome <hi>Saxons</hi> were not the leaſt Authors, who had for ſome time born a ſpite againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; from whoſe Authority and Protection they had ſeveral thoughts and conſultations of withdrawing themſelves. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, <hi>Henry</hi> had built ſeveral ſtrong Caſtles and Forts amongſt them, which incenſed them more; inſomuch, that they did not onely fortifie and defend themſelves, but ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> complaints againſt the Emperour of Oppreſſion and Simony (which, <hi>

                  <p>After him was Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, who was firſt call'd <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and under that name commonly met withal in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the <hi>Germans,</hi> who above all things hated him, for jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake uſed to call him <hi>Hellebrand,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Firebrand from Hell;</hi> they looking upon him to be the cauſe of all their misfortunes, whilſt ſome others magnifie him no leſs than a Saint.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> had not been above a year Pope, but he ſent his Legats into <hi>Germany,</hi> who, though they behaved themſelves ſtoutly to the Emperour, yet could not procure the Priviledge of having a Synod held there by them, the native Biſhops not being willing to ſubmit to ſuch Maſters; the chief of the Oppoſers being <hi>Liemarus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Breme,</hi> whom they undertook to ſuſpend; and the Pope after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thought he had completed it; and at laſt, <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1075.</note> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſeveral Biſhops, who adher'd to the Emperour.

                  <p>The ſtrangeneſs and boldneſs of this Papal ſummons moved the Emperour ſo much, that he not onely ſent away the <hi>Legats</hi> with ſcorn, but ſent forth Orders to all Biſhops and Abbots to meet him at <hi>Worms,</hi> there to hold a Council; who accordingly appear'd in a very great <note n="b" place="margin">Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In this I follow <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1076. § 25, 26.</note>

                  <p>Preſently after this, <hi>Gregory</hi> ſends to the <hi>Germans</hi> to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> would ſubmit himſelf, and acknowledge his offences againſt St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church; but if he would not, that then another King might be choſen, who would be obedient to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, and he would confirm the Election. Upon this, the Chief met at <hi>Tribur</hi> neer <hi>Mentz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour perceiving his caſe to be but bad, many of his chief friends forſaking him, and others for fear durſt not ſeem for him, [ſo apt were the ſimple people then to be gull'd and terrified by thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> bibble-babbles, or the ſeditious Nobles] was in a peck of troubles, ſeeing himſelf ſo neglected. And thus finding few friends, and no remedy, he ſends to thoſe who met at <hi>Tribur,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring their favours and pardon for what he had formerly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and promiſeth amendment, if they would onely look upon him as a Monarch: all this they refuſe, pretending his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and Depoſition by <hi>Gregory,</hi> and ſeveral other ſuchlike tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling excuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> thus ſeeing all hopes loſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> reſolves to ſubmit himſelf to the Pope: to effect which, he deſigned a journey into <hi>Italy.</hi> The factious <hi>Germans</hi> informed of this, reſolve to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay him, and if they could poſſibly intrap him, and get him into their clutches; but by making the fartheſt about, the neereſt way to his journies end, he eſcapes all their Ambuſhments and Malice. Yet was his journey moſt difficult and hazardous, by reaſon of the extremity of the Froſt, which put him ſeveral times in great danger, in his paſſage over the Alpes. Having entred <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> many <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops and Nobles wait upon him, entertain him with all reſpect, complain to him of the Popes actions, and wiſh that he had friends and ſtrength enough to depoſe <hi>Gregory,</hi> of whoſe Popedom they were really weary.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not this much better the Emperours poor condition: <note place="margin">Anno 1077.</note> For thoſe who had been his friends and well-wiſhers in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places, ſeeing <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf brought ſo low, as to drudge for pardon, thought it their ſecureſt way to do ſo too; and ſo they alſo gad to <hi>Italy,</hi> and bare-footed, without any linnen about them, humbly beg abſolution of the Pope; which after ſome hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and waiting they obtain, with an injunction never to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Henry,</hi> till he had asked pardon of, and ſatisfied his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> thus ſeeing his condition grow worſe and worſe, thought it wiſeſt to make the beſt he could of a bad Market; and unwilling
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109877:134"/> to looſe the Empire, reſolves to ſatisfie the Pope, if any thing can do it; and being informed that <hi>Gregory</hi> was at <hi>Canoſſa,</hi> a ſtrong place in the Territory of <hi>Reggio,</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Modena;</hi> thither he goeth to ſupplicate for pardon and reſtoration. This Caſtle of <hi>Canoſſa</hi> was compaſs'd about with three Walls, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> or <hi>Maude,</hi> a Lady of great Revenues, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with the Pope, ſeldom parting from him.

The night comes, the Froſt continueth, and his ſtomach might well think his throat <note place="margin">

                  <p>Having thus with pain, cold and hunger paſt over the tedious night, two to one but next morning he might hope for better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but he was ſerved with the ſame ſauce as the day before: And thus he paſt over three days and three nights, enough to get deſperation, if not death, in a better man than Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who thus deſpiſed the birth, dignity, and patience of ſo great an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. But the fourth day, ſome others with <hi>Mathilda,</hi> as if aſhamed of the arrogancie of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the unparallell'd humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Henry,</hi> with much ado perſwaded <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to allow the Emperour his preſence: but yet before this was done, <hi>Henry</hi> was to <hi>deliver up his Crown, and the reſt of his Royal Badges and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to the Pope, and acknowledge himſelf not fit or worthy to Rule.</hi> And having gone thus far on his knees, he humbly begs Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which, after a great deal of clutter, was granted, though the remedy was as bad as the diſeaſe, by the hard conditions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo's it was clog'd withal; As, that <hi>he ſhall ſubmit himſelf to anſwer</hi>

                     <hi>Genebrard</hi> mainly commends <hi>Gregory</hi> for his making the Emperour thus to dance attendance to him, in that naked poſture and frozen weather.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:109877:134"/>
                  <p>Hiſtory tells us, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fifth dying, the Cardinals then at <hi>Bologna,</hi> thought upon ſeveral as fit to ſucceed; but none of them would pleaſe <hi>Balthaſar Coſſa,</hi> Cardinal and Legat there; inſomuch, that ſeeing no remedy, they deſired him to nominate: upon which, quoth <hi>Coſſa, Give me St.</hi> Peters <hi>Cloak, and I will give it to him who is to be Pope.</hi> The Mantle being given him, he puts it on his own ſhoulders, and ſaid to them, <hi>I am Pope.</hi> Nor durſt they oppoſe that Election, ſince it was the will of <hi>Coſſa,</hi> who call'd himſelf <hi>John</hi> XXIII.</p>
                  <p>No man can be but ſatisfied, when he hath the power or liberty of ſetting down his own conditions, as <hi>Coſſa</hi> had his hearts-wiſh when he had the Popedom; ſo could <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh deſire or expect no more, than thus forcing the great Emperour to ſubmit to his will and pleaſure. Now he might ſuppoſe he had the world in a ſtring, and had ſhewn a fair preſident to make Temporal Monarchs obedient; and the truth is, he had rais'd up his Seat many degrees above any of his Predeceſſors; though after-ſtories will ſhew this equal'd, if not out-thrown ſome bar-lengths.</p>
                  <p>But having now ſeen the diſreſpect of <hi>Gregory,</hi> with the humility and abſolution of <hi>Henry;</hi> let us caſt a glance on the actions in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> We gave an hint before of ſome heart-burnings between the Emperour and <hi>Saxons;</hi> which upon the Popes Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ridiculous Depoſition, they advanced to more formality, thinking then they had ſufficient right and authority to renounce their Soveraign; and in his abſence in <hi>Italy,</hi> about his abſolution, they ſtruck the nail on the head, quite renouncing their obedience to <hi>Henry,</hi> and chuſing for their King or Emperour <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Reinfeldt,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Schwaben,</hi> by ſome Hiſtorians cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly call'd Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> No ſooner was this done and known, but both <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Rodolph</hi> deſire the Popes aſſiſtance. <hi>Gregory</hi> gave good words, commanded them both to appear before his Legats in <hi>Germany,</hi> where they ſhould have juſtice done them: And to his Legats, he gave expreſs command, to reject him that ſeem'd refractory, but to confirm him that was obedient as King.</p>
                  <p>How they behaved themſelves I know not, but <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1077. and <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> anno 1077. <hi>Guil. Barclay,</hi> de poteſt. Papae, pag. 40, 41.</note> 
                     <hi>Sigebert,</hi> a diligent Chronologer, who lived in <hi>Germany</hi> at this time, tells us that this year the Pope ſent to <hi>Rodolph</hi> an Imperial Crown with this Inſcription:

                           <hi>Petra dedit</hi> Petro, Petrus <hi>Diadema</hi> Rodolpho.</l>

                        <hi>The Rock did give this Crown to</hi> Peter,</l>

                  <p>But <note n="b" place="margin">Chron. <hi>Sclavorum</hi> cap. 28. lib. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Helmoldus</hi> affords us another Verſe, though not much differing in the ſence or purpoſe.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Petra dedit</hi> Romam Petro, <hi>tibi Papa Coronam.</hi>

                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And here methinks 'tis pretty to ſee what a clutter they make,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109877:135"/> to prove the <hi>Rock</hi> not to be the confeſſion of, but <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; the better thereby to intail Infallibility upon his Vicars; and yet here a great Pope makes them different things. But waving this, I wonder who gave <hi>Peter</hi> a Crown or <hi>Rome!</hi> or by what right he came to poſſeſs any Lands or Temporal Juriſdiction in <hi>Italy;</hi> not denying but that people may give away their own (provided they do not thereby begger and ruine themſelves, Children and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) but putting no truſt or truth in that common ſaying, That <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is founded in Grace or Saintſhip;</hi> ſeeing without doubt, an Heathen hath as much right to what is his, as a Chriſtian, were he St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, to what is his.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt Verſe, <hi>Baronius</hi> will not have it to be ſent to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi> this year, but three years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1080; but for this he ſhews no Authority, onely his own conjecture, not enough to weigh down the Teſtimony of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> living at the ſame time, and of old <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> But I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with the timing of theſe Verſes, nor with a Narrative of every Battle and Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Rodolph:</hi> For now were they hard at it; <hi>Henry</hi> no ſooner hearing of <hi>Rodolph</hi>'s Election and Coronation by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> (once his great friend,) but he raiſeth what force he can, haſtes for <hi>Germany,</hi> and doth his utmoſt to regain his Empire: but paſſing by the bloudſhed, which continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with eagerneſs of both ſides, let us ſee what <hi>Gregory</hi> doth at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we finde him in a Synod, curſing with Bell, Book and <note place="margin">An. 1080.</note> Candle all Emperours, Kings, Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſhall give any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtitures, i. e.</hi> nominate (as all Kings do now) any man to avoid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, or other Eccleſiaſtical Livings or Benefices, within their own Dominions or Juriſdictions, becauſe (forſooth) he could have all thoſe Donations to belong to him and his Succeſſors; for which you may ſuppoſe, they good men deſired no Politick Benefit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inriching of their Pockets, and the beggering of all other Countries by making all their Angels flee to <hi>Rome:</hi> Or, by thus having all the Clergy of the World at their Devotion, they might with more facility raiſe Rebellions at pleaſure, and make the Temporal Juriſdiction but a meer ſhadow; the Kings themſelves to be depoſed, when their Holyneſſes pleas'd to withdraw their favours.</p>
                  <p>And this Council will afford us a good inſtance to this purpoſe, and that concerning our Emperour <hi>Henry.</hi> For here we have him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Excommunicated, and deprived, with the ſalvation of all his Enemies.

                  <p>For his now Eldeſt Son <hi>Henry (Conrade</hi> being dead) was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by wicked counſel, that it was beſt to look about him, and take the Government upon him, his Father having no right to Rule by reaſon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Decree againſt him.

                  <p>Being thus down the winde, there were ſmall hopes of recruting, every one now running over to the Conqueror.

My good Fathers, break not your Oaths: I am now old, and you need ſtay but a little. But if there be no remedy, I ſhall deliver the Crown to my Son with mine own hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they making offer to lay hands upon him, he retired himſelf, put on his Imperial Enſigns, and returned to them, ſaying, <hi>The goodneſs of God, and the election of the Princes, gave theſe to me; and God is able to preſerve them unto me, and to with-hold your hands from this action, although We want Our Forces, though I doubt not of any ſuch violence,</hi> &amp;c. Hereupon the Biſhops ſtay'd a while, as if they knew not what to do; yet at laſt, incouraging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they bolted up the Emperour, took the Crown from his head, and then taking him out of his ſeat, took from him all his Royal Robes. The grieved old Emperour fetching a deep ſigh, ſpake to this purpoſe, <hi>The God of vengeance behold, and revenge this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity you commit against me: I ſuffer ignominy, the like whereof was never heard of: But it is God that juſtly puniſheth me for the ſins of my youth: Yet for all this, are not you free from this offence,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109877:137"/> having broken your Oaths, and ſo ſhall not avoid the revenge of a juſt Judge. Let God never proſper you upon earth, but let your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be with him who betray'd Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know ſome hint ſo ſlightly on this ſtory, as if they were willing to paſs it by in ſilence: And others, to mitigate the crime, would gladly perſwade us, that the Emperour did willingly on his own head depoſe himſelf. But 'tis a poor excuſe, to conquer a man by force, beat him ſoundly with an intent to make him deliver, and then to ſay, that he gave his purſe freely, when he was not able to keep it, and you were reſolved to have it. And that the Father had really no minde to part with his Authority and Dominion, his former battles againſt his Son for keeping them may teſtifie, and his after-actions may ſufficiently confirm it: for getting liberty, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently as he could, he withdrew himſelf to <hi>Colen,</hi> thence to <hi>Liege,</hi> and by his Letters declares to all Chriſtian Princes and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how baſely he had been uſed: for a taſte of which hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, you may peruſe his complaining Letter to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> it being ſomewhat long, I ſhall refer you to the reading of it in <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1106.</note> 
                     <hi>Sigebert.</hi> And that he indeavour'd to reſtore himſelf by Arms, by the aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> Hiſtory will tell at large: And are all theſe ſigns of a willing and free reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
                  <p>But at laſt, young <hi>Henry</hi> gets his old Father again into his clutches, where we cannot but ſuppoſe that the ancient Emperour was brought into exceſſive miſery; for proof of which, take this one ſtory teſtified by their own Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Henry,</hi> amongſt other buildings of Devotion, had built at <hi>Spire</hi> a Monaſtery, dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and ſeeing thus all means of a free livelyhood taken from him, applyed himſelf to <hi>Gebhard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Spire,</hi> one to whom he had been a ſpecial Friend, having not onely indowed the Church well, but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to his honours: Of this Biſhop, he deſires one favour, and that but a poor one too, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would grant him the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to live as an aſſiſtant in that Church, which he himſelf had built and indowed; telling of him withal that he was ſomewhat qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſuch an imployment, becauſe he had been brought up at his book, and had ſome skill to aſſiſt in the Chair. To which ſmall requeſt, the ungrateful Biſhop tartly replies with an <note n="b" place="margin">Per Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem Domini non faceam tibi quod pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. <hi>Helmold.</hi> Hiſt. <hi>Sclav.</hi> cap. 33.</note> Oath, that he ſhould not there be entertain'd; though according to their <note n="c" place="margin">16. q. 7. <hi>Quincun<expan>

                  <p>Now may we ſuppoſe that the living friends of the old Emperour went all to wrack, when the dead could not eſcape the tyranny of their Popiſh Enemies. <hi>Clement</hi> the Third his body, after it had laid in the Grave five years at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> was dig'd up again as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that holy Earth; and ſo were the Biſhops of his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating ſerved. Nor did the Corps of the deceaſed Emperour fare any better: for though at firſt it was buryed at <hi>Liege</hi> by the Biſhop
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109877:138"/> of that City; but theſe men being under Church-Cenſures for their affection to old <hi>Henry,</hi> they were not permitted to be received into Abſolution and Church-Communion again, till they had dug up the Imperial Corps, and without any Ceremony laid it on uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated ground; and to this their Archbiſhops and Biſhops gave their conſents. This being done, with the approbation of young <hi>Henry,</hi> it was convey'd to <hi>Spire,</hi> and there laid by the <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>A man might think that young <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth having thus got the Empire, ſhould be great friend to the Pope, and they two be hand and glove: But ſtorie tells us the quite contrarie; inſomuch, that now he thinks he is obliged to vindicate the rights of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, though againſt the Pope himſelf; which he formerly looked upon really, (or was perſwaded by the flattering <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſo) to be no leſs than abominable Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>He being Emperour, Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> declares his intent to meet him at <hi>Ausburg</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> but upon ſome jealouſie, he turns into <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Troyes</hi> holds a Synod, where they fell to taking away the Emperours power of <hi>Investitures:</hi> but againſt this, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> by his Ambaſſadors proteſted, alledging, that the Biſhops of another Country were not to be judges of his juriſdiction.

                     <p>HOwever, waving theſe, (though treaſonable enough) we ſhall come to the next, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, of part of whoſe Reign it will not be amiſs to give ſome hints, ſeeing ſo great a man as <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> is concerned in it, whom, ſome call <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> whilſt others allow him no better title than a <hi>Traytor.</hi> But of this with all brevity.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was Son to one <hi>Gilbert Becket,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London;</hi> and by the favour of <hi>Theobald,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was made an Archdeacon in that See, and was placed about the perſon of <hi>Henry,</hi> then but Duke; who coming to be King, advanced him to be Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> and upon the death
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109877:141"/> of the former <hi>Theobald,</hi> made him Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Having thus ſeen the great riſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> by the Kings love, grace and favour; let's now ſee how he loſt the affection of King <hi>Henry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſome time he thus lived in great repute with the King, though <hi>Henry</hi> was a little troubled at the humour or deſign of <hi>Thomas,</hi> to throw up his Chancellorſhip without acquainting him with it. After this, the Pope call'd a Council at <hi>Tours,</hi> whither went the two Archbiſhops, and ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>England;</hi> having firſt procured the Kings <note n="a" place="margin">Per miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Regis. <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> an. 1164</note> leave for going thither: Where an ancient <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Guil. Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brig.</hi> lib. 2. c. 16.</note> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tells us, that <hi>Thomas</hi> privately ſurrendred up his Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to the Pope, as if the Kings Nomination or Inveſtiture had not been ſufficient, which was reſtored again by the Pope, and ſo <hi>Thomas</hi> was cockſure of both Preſentations and Authorities. And probably this underhand-dealing, and nulling of his juriſdiction, might ſomewhat alienate the affection of <hi>Henry,</hi> although <hi>[c] Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>d</hi> An. 1163. § 29.</note> will not allow of any ſuch ſurrender at this time, though for his diſſent we muſt not be content onely with his word, neither producing Reaſon or Authority for his ſo doing; ſince 'tis probable enough, being thus back'd with the Teſtimony of <hi>Neubrigenſis,</hi> that <hi>Thomas</hi> might yeild it up now in his Proſperity for a farther confirmation; and in his low condition do it alſo, to procure pity, and ſo make his party there the ſtronger againſt his King and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, which was then his main deſign.</p>
                     <p>Add to theſe, the ſtrange Priviledges the Clergy boaſted of, by exempting themſelves from all ſecular juriſdiction, were the crime never ſo villanous; inſomuch, that a Prieſt of the Dioceſs of <hi>Sarum</hi> having murder'd one, <hi>Thomas</hi> had him deprived and placed in an Abbey, that ſo he might not fall under greater puniſhment (according to his deſert) by the Kings Juſticiaries, leſt, forſooth, he ſhould ſuffer twice for one fault. And upon this laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Priviledge may we lay the Foundation of the following troubles.</p>
                     <p>For the King perceiving no ſigns of Peace and Tranquillity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Subjects, if this exception of the Clergy was permitted, the people of that Coat having committed above an hundred Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſhort time he had yet Reigned; was reſolved, that all the Clergy, who were taken in any <hi>Robbery, Murder, Felony, burning of Houſes,</hi> and the like, ſhould be tryed in Temporal Courts, and ſuffer, as well as Laymen. Againſt this wholeſome Law, the Archbiſhop oppoſeth himſelf, and will onely grant that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Speed.</hi> § 14.</note> all Clergy-men ſo offending ſhould be tryed in the Spiritual Courts, and by men in Orders; who, if they were found guilty, ſhould for the firſt time onely be deprived of their Office and Benefice; yet he granted that for the ſecond time they might lye at the Kings pleaſure, as ſome think, though <note n="d" place="margin">
                           <hi>Baron.</hi> an. 1163. § 31.</note> others confeſs that he would not allow them at any time to be delivered over to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Authority.</p>
                     <p>And for theſe irrational Priviledges, <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſo reſolute, that at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> he openly oppoſed the King, and got others to do ſo too; which mightily incenſed his Majeſty, but pleaſed Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third to the purpoſe; yet fearing their hearts might fail them, he ſends his incouraging lines into <hi>England,</hi> commanding them by vertue of their obedience, to ſtand firm for the Exemption
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:109877:141"/> of the Clergy, nor at all to conſent to the King; and that if he, or <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Baron.</hi> an. 1163. § 39, 40.</note> any of the reſt had in theſe times promiſed obedience to the King, not to keep ſuch promiſes: but all this did not much prevail.</p>
                     <p>For the King was reſolved to have the Laws and Cuſtoms of his Anceſtors kept up in full force; and carryed his buſineſs ſo well, that at laſt, he had not onely the other Biſhops of his opinion, but <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo conſenting, who faithfully promiſed, and ſware to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. And for their farther ratification and authority, the King calls an Aſſembly at <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where the Biſhops and Nobility meet him, and <hi>John of Oxford</hi> ſat as Preſident. But here <hi>Thomas,</hi> for all his former promiſe, at firſt abſolutely falls off, and denyeth conſent to the Conſtitutions; though at laſt he was ſo far worked upon, one way or another, that he there publickly ſware, that in the <hi>word of a Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>ſincerely,</hi> he would obſerve them to the King and his Heirs for ever. But when the King would have him to Subſcribe and Seal to them (as the other Biſhops had done) he abſolutely refuſed, and retracted what he had formerly ſworn.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutions in all were ſixteen; but thoſe which <hi>Thomas</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were ſuch as theſe:</p>

                        <hi>benefits of a peaceable reconciliation: hereby was conceived an hope that you might from above bring into his Majeſties heart ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he would out of Kingly mercy relent in his wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and never recall to minde the injuries offer'd by reaſon of your departure.

But now, by the relation of ſome, we underſtand, which we cannot but with grief remember, that you publiſhed againſt him a ſeverer Commination; wherein you let paſs all ſalutation; wherein you practice no Counſel or Petition for Grace; wherein you neither adviſe, nor write any thing that ſavoureth favourably; but with all extremity do rigorouſly menace Interdiction or Excommunication against him: Which were it as ſharply executed, as it is bitterly ſpoken, we ſhould not then hope for peace, but ſhould fear to be inflamed with an irrevocable and eternal hatred.—Thus,—whilſt, as it were, with a drawn ſword you joyn battle, you have not left for your ſelf any place for Petition. Wherefore (O Father) we charitably adviſe you, not to heap labours upon labours, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon injuries; but ſetting threatning aſide, you would rather imbrace patience and humility. Commend your cauſe to Divine Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, and your ſelf to the grace and mercy of your Soveraign; and in ſo doing, you ſhall heap and caſt together coals of fire upon the heads of many.—It is better to be highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for voluntary poverty, than to be openly taxed by all men for ingratitude for a received Benefit. It is deeply rooted into the mindes of all men, how gracious our Lord the King hath been unto you; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how great dignity he hath rais'd you from poor degree, and received you into his favour ſo freely and frankly, as the ample bounds of his Dominions, reaching from the Northern Sea, to the</hi> Pyrenean <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, were by him ſo abſolutely ſubject unto your power, as through all thoſe Principalities, they were onely accounted happy, who could finde but favour in your ſight: And that no worldly mutability might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw your proſperity and glory, he laid your foundation moſt firm, in the poſſeſſion belonging to God: And, notwithſtanding his Mother diſſwaded, the Kingdom cryed out againſt it, and the Church of God (ſo far as ſhe could) ſighed and groan'd thereat; he indeavoured by all means poſſibly to raiſe you unto the dignity of your preſent preferment, hoping he ſhould hereafter Reign bleſſedly, and enjoy your aſſiſtance and counſel with exceeding ſecurity. If therefore, where he expected ſecurity to defend him, he ſhall finde a ſword to offend: What rumour will be ſpread of you by all men? what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? what a remembrance will this be of a requital never heard of before?

                     <p>All theſe indeavours failing, the Pope once again undertook the <label type="milestone">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeeing no remedy, and all againſt him, condeſcended to their deſires, went to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and kneeling down, ſubmitted himſelf to God and the King; but ſtill with this reſervation of <hi>the honour of God and his holy Order.</hi> But this <hi>Henry</hi> rejects as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, alledging that <hi>Thomas,</hi> by that <hi>Salvo,</hi> would upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion exclude the honour of his King. However, <hi>Henry</hi> declared that he required nothing of him, but that he, as a Prieſt and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſhould before them all <hi>truely promiſe without any deceipt</hi> to obſerve the Cuſtoms which the holy Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had obſerved to their Kings, and which <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf had once promiſed him to do. But <hi>Thomas</hi> would conſent to nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch <hi>Salvo's</hi> as formerly mentioned; which conditional obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo vext the King, that he affirmed, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould never enter <hi>England,</hi> till he had done to him as he ought to do; and had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to obſerve what others had obſerved, and what himſelf had formerly promiſed. And thus broke off this buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>And the truth is, the King might have ſome reaſon to be more and more incenſed againſt <hi>Thomas,</hi> who inſtead of ſeeking the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and friendſhip of his Soveraign, had excommunicated his chief Friends; and went ſo far againſt others, that there was <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Speed</hi> § 32.</note> ſcarce found in the Kings own Chappel and preſence, ſuch as might perform the wonted Ceremonies. And beſides, did daily threaten an <hi>Interdict</hi> againſt his whole Dominions; and had done it, but that ſome more prudent over-perſwaded him to the contrary; and the Pope himſelf thought it beſt to lay his commands on him not to do it till farther Order.</p>
                     <p>But this was not all, for they proceed yet more and more to vex his Majeſty: For he being now about fifty years old, and ſeeing the uncertainty of obedience, and not knowing what the pretence of Church-authority might do to his Children, if he ſhould dye excommunicated, as it was daily threatned him; or not in favour with the Pope, as he might ſuſpect upon <hi>Thomas</hi> his account: Upon theſe and other reaſons, he roſolved to ſettle his Succeſſion by the Coronation of his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> now fourteen years old.</p>
                     <p>This reſolution being made known, the Pope thought that now <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1170</label> he might compel the King to admit of <hi>Thomas,</hi> or neglect the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, under the pretence that that Ceremony belong'd of right to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and ſo to hinder any other from performing it, he wrote an <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>This reſolution of the King, or ſomething elſe, did a little cool the Pope; and having put on his conſidering cap, he ſeem'd not ſo violent againſt the Coronation, as formerly, though <hi>Thomas</hi> cryed out, that he and his authority was undone by it: but to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, the Pope ſent him a Paper-remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> that that action ſhould not for the future be any <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>Now had the world for almoſt ſeven years been troubled with this quarrel between a King and his Subject; inſomuch, that all parties grew almoſt weary of it. And now once more to try if any good could be done, a treaty was brought about again. For this, the Pope ſends his Legats, and ſome threats againſt <hi>Henry,</hi> if peace not preſently made; and <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo uſed his humour to procure an Agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> threatning to <note n="c" place="margin">Id. § 24.</note>

                     <p>But in brief, a Conference was had between the King and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> in a place call'd by the Inhabitants, <note n="e" place="margin">Pratum Proditorum.</note>

                     <p>And the truth is, by degrees they intended to ſweep up all the Imperial Priviledges to themſelves; and as formerly they had made a good progreſs, ſo they now continue; for here we finde Pope <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Paſchal</hi> II to alter the date of the Papal writings: for whereas, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, they uſed to be dated with the year of the Emperours Raign, he rejects that form, and ſubſcribes the year of his own Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which cuſtom hath been ſince continued by his ſucceſſors. But the chief of all was the pretty conceited cuſtom of their Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperours, which as they had hitherto ſeveral times carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on under pretty pretences, and a ſpecious awe of their Paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures; ſo would they not willingly leave off that deſign, making thereby an Argument, that none can be Emperour, but of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation or Approbation; and from their making, drawing out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of their power in nulling or diſpoſing.</p>
                     <p>And thus had they awed or gull'd the greateſt Monarchs to their Lure.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1155</label> though ignorance held the left Stirrop; which ſo incenſed the Pope, that he told the Biſhop of <hi>Bamberg</hi> (who had made a Speech in <note place="margin">

The Emperour as well as he could excuſed himſelf, alledging it was meerly through ignorance, that being the firſt time that ever he held one in his life. But this no way ſatisfied the Pope, intimating, that if he pleaded ignorance for his neglect of ſmall things, there was little hopes of his performing the greater. The Emperour a little angry at theſe frumpiſh humours, deſired to know whence that cuſtom came: for if it were onely of good will, he had done enough; and if it were upon duty, he had ſhew'd his humility, though he miſtook the Stirrop. And thus in a pet they both parted for that time; the Pope affirming he would not Crown him, till he had done his duty.</p>
                     <p>This ſtory related by that ancient Hiſtorian, <hi>Helmodus,</hi> who lived at this time, and ſo might know beſt, is a little varied from by <note n="c" place="margin">An. 1155. § 12, 13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Baronius,</hi> who tells it to this purpoſe: The Emperour and Pope being met, <hi>Frederick</hi> refuſed to hold his Stirrop; whereupon the Cardinals were out of their little wits, and ſhuffled away; and the Pope was as troubled as any of them, not knowing what to do, yet he permitted the Emperour to kiſs his feet; but denyed him the <hi>kiſs of peace;</hi> and why he did ſo, he thus tells the Emperour—<hi>Becauſe thou hast not done to me that wonted and due</hi>

                     <p>And ſo he yeilded to it; and for the more honour of the Play, the Emperour muſt go a little out of the way, and all his Army drawn up to ſee the ſhew, then muſt his Holineſs be mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bonny Palfry, ride along, as if nothing were; whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſeeing a pretty way off, very mannerly met him, and very dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly performed his duty at the Stirrop: and then his Humbleneſs received <hi>Frederick</hi> into his favour, and no queſtion but he buſs'd him to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>And thus take which of the ſtories you pleaſe, no queſtion but you will think that the Vicar thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> miſtook himſelf, when he ſaid, his <hi>Kingdom was not of this world.</hi> So now, thanks to our Country-man <hi>Adrian,</hi> we ſee it brought to that paſs, that if you will not be a ſlave at my Stirrop, you ſhall not be Crown'd; and ſo according to them no Emperour. For now that <hi>Frederick</hi> had
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109877:151"/> proved himſelf a white boy, and plyable to all manner of drudgery; the Pope took the pains to Crown him, but told him, that he ſhould win <hi>Apulia,</hi> and ſuchlike petty lands to the Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew his reſpect to St. <hi>Peter:</hi> the Emperour in the mean time, looking very demurely at theſe canting documents, though ſhew'd his indignation at the Picture of <hi>Conradus</hi> his kneeling to <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and the verſes, of which there was promis'd amendment.</p>
                     <p>But here before I go any farther with the Pope, let me tell you one remarkable paſſage which hapned in <hi>Germany,</hi> which may be as an <hi>Item</hi> againſt Rebels, and diſturbers of the Peace.</p>

But firſt it will not be amiſs to ſee how he came to the Pontifical greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholas</hi> IV dying, the Chair was void about two years: the Cardinals not agreeing in the choice, at laſt one <hi>Petrus de Morone</hi> a pious Hermit was elected, and call'd <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> V. All of their Authors acknowledging him for a true and legitimate Pope, and accordingly the ſeveral Cardinals by him created, legal.</p>
                  <p>Yet if their <hi>Canon-Law</hi> be Authentick, and in this caſe ought to be obſerved, as the Pope ſeverely injoyneth, then muſt this <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> be no Pope, becauſe he was never a <note n="e" place="margin">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:109877:164"/> then I know not how they can make up a true Pope ſince that time; by which rule the Bead-roll of their Pontiffs ended above three hundred years ago.</p>

                  <p>This made ſome, after he had been Pope a little while, conſult his depoſition; to which they thought it no hard matter to get his own conſent; and he who moſt concern'd himſelf to procure this degradation, was (according to the common Opinion of their own Writers) Cardinal <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Yet againſt all this, the Cardinals reaſon'd that the Church might be in danger by ſuch a man; and therefore they muſt mend themſelves by the choice of one more fit for Chriſtendom, and to be Chriſts Vicar.

                  <p>The King was highly offended that the Arch-deacon of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> his own Subject, ſhould offer to come upon ſuch an errand, eſpecially to be the conveyer of ſuch mad and inſolent letters and threats, which were ſo ſcandalous even to the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, that the Earl of <hi>Artois</hi> ſnatch'd them from the Arch-Deacons hands, and threw them into the fire, where they were burn'd.

                  <p>After all theſe glories, <hi>Clement</hi> reconciles all between <hi>France</hi> and the Popedom, abſolving thoſe whom <hi>Boniface</hi> had Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; reſtored the Family of the <hi>Colonni,</hi> vindicating the King from any bad intentions in his actions againſt <hi>Boniface;</hi> yet he would not be as good as his Oath to daſh out the very memory of <hi>Boniface,</hi> though <hi>Philip</hi> ſeveral times urged him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to it.

                  <p>To conclude with this <hi>Clement,</hi> take one ſtory: ſeveral Monks had bought great priviledges of the Pope, of which they were as proud, as he glad of their Caſh.

Be it as 'twill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Authors differ in their Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and <note n="b" place="margin">An. 1314.</note> 
                        <hi>Spondanus</hi> ſcarce knows what to think of it. However, both parties declared himſelf Emperour, and was Crown'd, both ſent to the Pope for Confirmation, and both denyed; nor did he trouble his pate with the mending of the buſineſs, ſo that it ſeems 'twas all one to him, fight Dog, fight Bear; the leſning of Emperours, being ſome cauſe of his greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>By theſe diviſions <hi>Germany</hi> was pitifully rent to pieces: for now the ſword muſt try the buſineſs; and at laſt <hi>Lewes</hi> is <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,</hi> and takes his Antagoniſt <hi>Frederick</hi> priſoner, whom ſome thought he would have put to death, but he was more noble, onely <label type="milestone">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewes</hi> now thought all was done, but he found another ſort of warfare; for Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII favouring <hi>Frederick,</hi> pulls out his tools againſt <hi>Lewes,</hi> accuſing him of ſeizing upon the Empire (and why did not the Pope then long before provide for this?) aſſiſting of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, (and no wiſe man but will look every where for aſſiſtance) and ſo gave him three months time to appear before him, and clear himſelf of thoſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt him. <hi>Lewes</hi> ſends Ambaſſadors to him, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf; but the Pope careth not for this, and ſo Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates him, declares him deprived of the Empire, and curſeth all thoſe who take his part. Againſt theſe, <hi>Lewes</hi> vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Imperial Authority, and appeals from the Pope to a General Council.</p>
                     <p>And now the Pens fall to work, every man vindicating as he was perſwaded: The Pope had <hi>Alvarus Pelagius</hi> a Spaniard, <hi>Petrus de Palude</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> but above all, <hi>Auguſtinus Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> a Mendicant <hi>Italian</hi> Fryar, who by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of this Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII, undertook to diſplay the Papal Authority; who according to his Maſters humour, hath made him ſo great, powerful, and ſupreme above all things, that,

                     <p>On the other hand, <hi>Lewes</hi> wanted not learned Champions, ſuch as were <hi>Marſileus Patavinus, Johannes de Janduno, Dante</hi> famous for his Poetry, Wit and Memory, and our famous Country-man <hi>William Ockam,</hi> who uſed to ſay to this <hi>Lewes</hi>

But though it ſeems that theſe two were agreed on the buſineſs, Pope <hi>John</hi> would not by any means permit <hi>Lewes</hi> to be Emperour, but damned him again with his Cenſures: Which made <hi>Lewes</hi> reject <hi>John</hi> as much, proceeding alſo againſt him with his Cenſures, nulling all that he had done againſt him, and at laſt by advice declares him to be no Pope, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHilſt theſe things were acting in <hi>Germany,</hi> there hapned an odd paſſage in <hi>Rome,</hi> that had it gone on, would have alter'd and non-plus'd all the Counſels and Contrivances both of Pope and Emperour; which being ſomewhat ſtrange, not unlike the late bravado of <hi>Thomas Anello</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> take it thus in ſhort for a diverſion.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Lewes, Charles,</hi> and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> were bandying it for the Empire, there ſtarted up at <hi>Rome</hi> one <hi>Nicolaus Gabrinus,</hi> ſon <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Having thus got abſolute Authority, and all the people obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his beck, through an odd humour he would have himſelf again baptized; which was performed with great ſolemnity in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church.

                     <p>He made and Ordain'd Senators, diſpoſed of all places as he pleas'd; yet behaved himſelf ſo, that the people admired and loved him as one ſent from Heaven: and for that time, never was there more Peace and Juſtice in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that all men remain'd ſatisfied; and by conſequence he grew ſo ſtrong and powerful, that his fame ran all <hi>Europe</hi> over; the inferiour people loved him, the greater ſort, and Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> feared him, ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to him, ſought his friendſhip and favour.</p>
                     <p>And being thus rais'd to the top of greatneſs, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure and ſtrong enough, and ſo inlarged his pretended juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; he ſent to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> to come to <hi>Rome</hi> by ſuch a time, or elſe he would depoſe him, and elect another: he alſo ſent to <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> to appear before him, and to ſhew by what title and pretence they laid claim to the Empire; and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Electors to come to him too.

                     <p>This vanity having continued a few months, he perceives great deſigns againſt him, and the people weary of their own Idol; wherefore he ſteals from <hi>Rome,</hi> and is found with <hi>Charles,</hi> who ſends him to the Pope, by whom he is impriſoned.</p>
                     <p>He remain'd a priſoner about VI years, at latter end of which he grew into great favour with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> VI. About which time there hapned an action ſomwhat like the former.</p>

                     <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> informed of theſe mad-pranks, by advice, thinks it beſt to drive out one Peg with another; and ſo having

And thus much by the by for the giddy-headed <hi>Romans.</hi>

                        <hi>Venetians</hi> to redeem themſelves from the Cenſures of a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Pope. <hi>Azzo da Eſte</hi> II Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> having by his firſt Wife one <hi>Friſco,</hi> upon her death Marries again. <hi>Friſco</hi> upon ſome account fearing by this means to be out of favour, and at laſt to looſe his right of Government, by the advice of ſome of the <hi>Ferrarians,</hi> ſeizeth upon his Father, impriſons him, where he dyes, and then takes the Government upon himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The people upon this is divided, ſome for <hi>Friſco,</hi> whilſt other oppoſe him: in this condition, <hi>Friſco</hi> not being ſufficient of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conquer all, deſires the aſſiſtance of his Friends the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> they yeild to his requeſt, by which means <hi>Ferrara</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the V (of whom we ſpake formerly) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this, Excommunicates the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and perſwades all people to be their enemies, as oppoſing a City which the Pope declared to belong to the Protection of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> By this means the <hi>Venetians</hi> either in Travail or Traffick are abuſed every where; and, as ſome ſay, people thought they could do no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice than kill them where ever they met them.</p>
                     <p>However it was, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſtill went home by weeping croſs; they ſue, ſend and intreat for pardon, but it will not be granted. At laſt they ſent <hi>Franciſco Dandalo,</hi> one of great repute amongſt them, to uſe all his endeavour to get off this Interdict: <hi>Dandalo</hi> goeth to <hi>France,</hi> where the Pope then kept his Court, and after much intreaty, was admitted in, but denyed. <hi>Dandalo</hi> reſolved, if any thing could do it, not to return without it; gets a great Iron chain, one end of which he puts about his neck, with which like a Dog, under the Popes Table, he lyeth on the ground ſo long, that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:109877:172"/> the Pope being thus overcome, recals his Cenſures, and nulls the Interdict. A great ſign of the Ambaſſadors patience; but 'tis need makes the Old Wife trot: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were forced to this Slavery, by the great miſery they were brought into by the Popes <hi>Interdiction,</hi> whereby every one looked upon them to have no benefit of Chriſtian Law or favour. And if every one ought thus to truckle, that either ſeized upon other mens Dominions, or aſſiſts others ſo to do, how many Popes before this time had had their necks honour'd with an Iron-collar, and drag'd a Chain after them to the Table of Kings and Emperours? And a worſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ignominy doth he deſerve, that diſpoſſeſſeth another wrongfully. But the Pope after ſo many intreaties and confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fault, might have indulged this renowned Common-wealth, <note place="margin">

In which private journeys, the King indured all manner of ignominy and ſcorn by theſe two villanous Knights; as they made him ride bare-headed, would ſcarce allow him any ſleep or victuals, and contradicted and croſs'd him in every thing. One time <hi>Gurney</hi> made him a Crown of Hay, and put it on his Head, and crying with the reſt—<hi>Tprut avant Syr King,</hi> and <hi>Fare forth Syr King;</hi> (i e. go on.) Another time they would ſhave as well the hair of his head as his Beard: for which purpoſe they made him light from his jaded Horſe, ſet him on a Mole-hill, took water out of a Ditch cloſe by, ſaying, that ſhould ſerve for that time: which ſo overwhelmed the King with grief, that he told them, That <hi>would they nould they, he would have warm water for his head;</hi> and ſo at their inhumanity began to weep and ſhed tears plentifully.</p>
                     <p>And when he was a Priſoner in <hi>Barkly</hi> Caſtle, they uſed him much after the ſame way, (though <hi>Thomas Barkley</hi> then Lord of the place, greatly pittyed his ſad condition, wiſhing it in his power to redreſs it). At laſt Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> and her ſure friend in miſchief <hi>Adam de Orlton,</hi> upon advice thought it beſt to have him taken out of the world; whereupon they chid his keepers for keeping him ſo delicately, and gave hints enough to diſcover their meaning; but the moſt cunning of all was, the direction which the crafty Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> ſent down to them, in theſe words:

                        <q>For there is no queſtion but that when the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> were at <note place="margin">Myſt. of Jeſui. part 3. pag. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66.</note> a difference between themſelves concerning the form of their <hi>Capuchin</hi> (Cowl or Hood) when thoſe who would be call'd the <hi>Spiritual Brethren</hi> would have their Hood narrower, and others which they named the <hi>Brothers</hi> of the <hi>Communalty</hi> would have theirs of a larger ſize; they thought their diſpute wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: And in good earneſt the quarrel laſted almoſt a whole Age, with infinite heat and animoſity on both ſides, being at laſt with much ado determin'd by the <hi>Bulls</hi> of four Popes, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> IV, <hi>Clement</hi> V, <hi>John</hi> XXII, and <hi>Benedict</hi> XII.

                     <p>By this Schiſm or Schiſms which continued ſo many years, Chriſtendom received much detriment, each Party and Faction maintaining it ſelf with all earneſtneſs. <hi>

Queen of <hi>Naples</hi> (a lover of change) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to <hi>Clement,</hi> pronounceth her depoſed from her Kingdom, which he gives to <hi>Charles Durazzo.</hi> To counterpoiſe this, <hi>Joan</hi> (by the counſel of <hi>Clement)</hi> declares <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> Heir to the Kingdom, (and Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V confirm'd it afterwards) which increas'd the trouble: But in brief, <hi>Durazzo</hi> proves too ſtrong, enters <hi>Naples,</hi> ſeized upon Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> and cauſed her to be hanged.</p>
                     <p>And with that ſeverity did <hi>

                     <p>Nay, ſo zealous were the people of thoſe days for Schiſm, that neither the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> or <hi>Baſil</hi> could preſently end this diſturbance; for what Pope ſoever they nominate or approve of, falleth preſently out again with them, concerning whoſe Authority is greateſt, the Councils or the Popes; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelves to be above the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt on the other ſide his Holineſs pronounceth himſelf above all.</p>
                     <p>And theſe diſputes went ſo far, till at laſt it came to an equal Muſter, <hi>Felix</hi> and the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> againſt <hi>Eugenius</hi> and the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſo that either party was back'd with a Pope and Council.</p>
                     <p>As for the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> I may fancy that they took no great care for the preſervation of Kings, ſince they decreed onely this, that it was not lawful to kill Tyrants, with this kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh condition, <hi>Without the command or ſentence of a Judge;</hi> yet this Council (and ſo did <hi>Baſil)</hi> declare it ſelf above the Pope, and that he ought to be obedient to a Council: yet will not all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:109877:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> believe this, though thus decreed by a lawful Council, as they ſay; for if this be not legal, how can <hi>Martin</hi> V be a true Pope, being ſet up and choſen by it? and if he fail, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been a true one ſince. And beſides this, we may ſuppoſe that there hath been a notable jumbling of Cardinals, when in this very Schiſm there was about two hundred created, beſides thoſe who were made by <hi>Martin</hi> V, and <hi>Nicolas</hi> V.</p>
                     <p>But though this Schiſm was ſome trouble to Chriſtianity, yet the ſucceſſion of the Emperours went peacebly on; onely <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was depoſed for his vitious life, as if the troubles of the Popes were the peace of the Empire; and at theſe times, probably, the Popes are too buſily imploy'd to diſturb the <hi>German</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>As for the Council of <hi>Baſil, Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II, hath wrote much in its vindication: But when he came to be Pope, he changed his note, and declared againſt his former writings, decreeing that the Pope is above a Council: thus <hi>Intereſt</hi> can work Miracles; but for his unconſtancie he is pointed at by this Proverb, <hi>What</hi> Aeneas <hi>approves of, that</hi> Pius <hi>condemns.</hi> And <note place="margin">Quod <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt inckling that the King had of this Treaſon, was whilſt he was beſieging <hi>Roxbourgh</hi> in <hi>Teveot-dale,</hi> then defended by Sir <hi>Ralph Gray</hi> and his <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for when he had brought the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to that extremity, that they were conſulting of yeilding; his Queen in all haſte poſſible ſpeeds to him, and gives him ſome hints of the Treaſon, and that it was ſuch, that if not quickly prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would indanger him and his. Upon this he raiſeth the Siege, through jealouſie disbands moſt of his Army, and with thoſe whom he thought he might truſt, much troubled in minde with this villany, he goeth to <hi>Perth</hi> (now call'd St. <hi>Johnſtons)</hi> where he remains in the <hi>Black Fryars,</hi> a Covent neer the Town-Walls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Dominicans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the King bends all his wits to finde out the bottom of the Treaſon: which deſign of his being known to the Traytors, they reſolve for a ſpeedy execution, leſt delay might bring a farther diſcovery, and a ſtop to their wickedneſs. Accordingly, aſſiſted by the darkneſs of a night, they got undiſcovered to the <hi>Black-Fryars,</hi> one <hi>John</hi> belonging to the Court being their guide, and had alſo procured them entrance into the Gallery before the Kings Chamber-door, where they attended ſome of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, who ſhould have let them in farther in, by taking out the Bar on the in-ſide of the door; and <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> being a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite with the King, and ſo familiar at Court, took off all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and was a main aſſiſtant to their approach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were thus in expectation, Fortune was favourable to their Treaſon; for <hi>Walter Stratoun,</hi> one of the Kings Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, having not long before carryed in ſome Wine, came forth of the Chamber, and finding ſome armed men rudely ruſhing to force their entry, with a loud voice cryed out Treaſon; upon which they fall upon him, whom whilſt they were killing, a young Maid of Honour, named <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> others ſay <hi>Lovel,</hi> claps to the Door; but not finding the Bar, and ſeeing no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for their preſervations, thruſt her Arm in the hole or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thereby to keep the Door faſt.

                     <p>The firſt day, he was ſtript naked to his Shirt, and by a Crane ſixt to a Cart, after hoyſted aloft, his joynts put out; and thus hanging, ſhew'd to the people: and thus dragged along the high Street of <hi>Edinbourgh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond day, he was mounted on a Pillar in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and Crown'd with a Diadem of hot Iron, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:</p>

                     <p>To tell all his misfortunes, would be too tedious: In ſhort, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Nobility made a League againſt him, one of the chief of whom was <hi>Don Alphonſo Carillo</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> They carryed their plot cunningly and ſecret; and if a diſcovery ſhould happen, they had either fair pretenſions, or a jugling carriage, with which they knew it was an eaſie matter to pacifie the King.</p>
                     <p>The King had notice of their <hi>League,</hi> and deſired to confer with the Marqueſs <hi>De Villena,</hi> one of their Chieftains, and ſome others: they refuſe to come to him.

                        </gap> with a fair excuſe; and the King was too apt to pardon and believe all to be for the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Another time they had laid a plot to be let in ſecretly into their Lodgings, there to ſeize on the King, the Queen, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta's,</hi> and to diſpatch their Enemies; but this was by chance alſo diſcover'd, and ſo prevented: yet would not the King pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Villena,</hi> becauſe he had given him his word of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe failing, they contrived to ſeize upon him, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Conference; but of this alſo the King having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he prevented their Treachery. The <hi>Covenanters</hi> finding their plots diſcover'd, flee to open Arms, and draw up ſeveral Articles againſt the King; and the better to countenance their Cauſe, they pretended great care and friendſhip to the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> At laſt a kinde of peace is ſtruck up; <hi>Alphonſo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Heir to the Crown, and Commiſſioners on both ſides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to end all differences; and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> is ſent to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, to render them more peaceable by his preſence, and their thus enjoying of what they deſired.</p>
                     <p>Now the King hoped nothing more than an happy peace; but he found himſelf betray'd on all hands. For whilſt the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were conſulting, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and <hi>Don Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the Admiral, made ſhew as if they had fallen out with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>De Villena,</hi> were weary of the League, and ſo came over to the King, to whom they profer'd their ſervice. His Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth at this; but was preſently in troubles again, by reaſon of the treachery of his Commiſſioners, who being won over by the Confederates, had conſented to a diſhonourable peace, whereby nothing remain'd to the King ſave onely the name.</p>
                     <p>And this grief was doubled by another misfortune; for he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent to <hi>Don Gomes de Cacerez</hi> Maſter of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro Puertro Carero</hi> Earl of <hi>Medillino,</hi> his truſty friends, to come
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:109877:187"/> to him; it fortuned that whilſt they were upon their journey, they met with <hi>Alvaro Gomes</hi> Secretary to the King, and <hi>Ganzalo</hi> of <hi>Sahavedra,</hi> one of the Kings Commiſſioners, both now turn'd to the Confederates. Theſe two Traytors told the other two Nobles a ſmooth and ſad ſtory of the Kings diſpleaſure againſt them, how he had given order to have them ſeiz'd on, and ſo it would not be ſafe for their Lordſhips to fall within the reach of the King. Theſe Lords thus falſely perſwaded of the Kings diſpleaſure, forgot their honours, and joyned themſelves alſo with the Leaguers.</p>
                     <p>But yet the Kings misfortune grew worſe and worſe; for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and the Admiral, carryed themſelves ſo cunningly, that <hi>Henry</hi> ever put his greateſt confidence in them. And though he was ſecretly adviſed not to truſt too much to them, nor to commit any Forces to their charge, aſſuring him that they waited but that opportunity, and then would deliver them with themſelves over again to the Leaguers; yet to all theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations would he give no credit, but confer'd upon them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of ſtrength, furniſh'd them with money, and gave them Commiſſions to raiſe Souldiers, with an Order to meet him with their Forces at <hi>Arevalo,</hi> which place he deſigned with their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to beſiege.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This was ſad news.

                     <p>
                        <hi>O Lord God! unto whom belongeth the defence and protection of Kings, and by whom they reign: I recommend my Cauſe unto thee, and commit my life into thy hands: I yeild thee infinite thanks, that it hath pleas'd thee thus to puniſh me for mine offences, which are worthy of a ſharper ſcourge: And I confeſs, that the ſame which I ſuffer is very ſmall in reſpect of my deſerts. May it pleaſe thee (O Lord!) that theſe troubles may diminiſh the pains which are due to my ſoul, in regard of my ſins; and if it be thy will that I ſhall paſs through theſe miſeries and afflictions, I beſeech thee from the bottom of my heart, to give me patience to endure them, and reaſon and underſtanding to guide my ſelf in them.</hi>

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:109877:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> a Paper was read, by which <hi>Henry</hi> was degraded: it contain'd four chief points.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>As deſerving to be deprived from the dignity of a King:</hi> at which the Archbiſhop took the Royal Crown from its head.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>That he was no more worthy to adminiſter Juſtice:</hi> at which the Earl of <hi>Placencia</hi> took away the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>That he was unfit to govern the Kingdom:</hi> then the Earl of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevent</hi> took the Scepter out of its hand.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>That therefore he was deprived juſtly of his Royal Throne:</hi> then was the Statue thrown down from the Seat, with many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and outragious ſpeeches, by <hi>Diego Lopez,</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Placencia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This done, the other Lords, with <hi>Henries</hi> young brother <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> (who had ſtood a little off as ſpectators) mounted the Scaffold, took and lifted <hi>Alphonſo</hi> upon their Shoulders, crying out <hi>Caſtile, Caſtile</hi> for the King <hi>Don Alphonſo;</hi> ſo the Trumpets ſounded, and they all went to kiſs his hand as their true King.</p>
                     <p>Poor King <hi>Henry</hi> received this news patiently, ſaying with the Prophet <hi>Eſay—I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have deſpiſed me.—But although theſe treacherous and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſervants have ſo wrong'd and ſcorned me by the Statue which they have degraded, and thrown away all reſpect and duty which they owe unto me; yet they cannot keep me, who am the true King, from having ſtrength and courage to chaſtiſe and diſperſe them: For I hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the juſt Judge of Kings, that their wickedneſs ſhall be deſtroyed, and mine innocencie made known to the whole World.</hi> And then conſidering how many Places and Nobles revolted from him, and the powerfulneſs of his enemies, he would oftentimes ſay,—<hi>Naked I came out of my Mothers Womb, and the earth muſt receive me naked; no man can become ſo poor as he was born: And if God doth now chastiſe me for my ſins, he will comfort and preſerve me hereafter: for his infinite power killeth and giveth life; hurteth and healeth; giveth kingdoms, and taketh them away; lifteth up Kings, and throweth them down again, even as he pleaſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet did not the diſconſolate King abſolutely deſpair, but ſent to all places he had any hopes in to aſſiſt him againſt the Rebels; and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Don Garcia Alvares de Toledo</hi> Earl of <hi>Alva de Tormes,</hi> was very active for his ſervice.</p>

                     <p>The Reader may here underſtand by the by, that about the years 712, 713, 714, <hi>Julian</hi> Governour of <hi>Ceuta</hi> in the <hi>Streights</hi> on the <hi>African</hi> ſhore, falling out with his Lord <hi>Roderigo</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in revenge joyns himſelf with the <hi>Moores;</hi> with them enters <hi>Spain,</hi> routs his Prince; and by this treachery the <hi>Moores</hi> became Maſters of all that Continent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the mountanous parts in <hi>las Aſturias, Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Navar;</hi>
                        <pb n="340" facs="tcp:109877:188"/> and ſo retain'd it for many hundred years, till by degrees they were beaten out: And thus was the name and rule of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment loſt.</p>
                     <p>In this wicked treachery againſt their own Country and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, was as a principal Actor <hi>Opas</hi> or <hi>Oppa</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who joyned himſelf with unbelieving <hi>Moores,</hi> to the ſhame of himſelf, and the loſs of Chriſtianity in thoſe parts. And this is that <hi>Don Opas</hi> to whom theſe boys alluded.</p>
                     <p>The Image of the Archbiſhop being in all ſort prepared, one of the boys ſat down as Judge; and the Treaſon being palpable, commanded the Image to be impriſoned, and at laſt pronounced ſentence againſt it; thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereas</hi> Alphonſo Carillo <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Toledo, <hi>following the ſteps of the ancient Biſhop</hi> Opas, <hi>the ruine of</hi> Spain, <hi>for that he had betray'd the King his Natural Lord, rebelling againſt him, and detaining his Money, Towns and Fortreſſes, which he had committed to him, is therefore condemned to be drawn up and down the ſtreets, and publike places of</hi> Simancas; <hi>a Trumpet to go before, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the King did command this juſtice to be done to the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> Opas, <hi>as a recompence due for his Treacheries and Treaſons; and that then it ſhould be burn'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſentence pronounced aloud, we need not queſtion but the young Judge was obey'd in every thing. Then was the Image carryed out of the Town, attended on with above three hundred boyes, and burned with a great deal of triumph in the very ſight of the Confederates Army: which at laſt deſpairing of taking the Place, rais'd the ſiege.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> we may well ſuppoſe was not idle, having in a little time got an Army of near upon an hundred thouſand men. This vaſt ſtrength terrified the Leaguers; ſo they fell to private plots, and inſtigated one <hi>Juan Carillo</hi> to kill the King: but this <hi>Carillo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken priſoner in a skirmiſh, and perceiving he could not live long by reaſon of his wounds, was ſorry for what he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, deſired to ſpeak with the King, ask'd pardon of him, had it, confeſs'd how his life was ſought after, and revealed to him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked practices againſt him; and the next day <hi>Carillo</hi> dyed of his wounds.</p>
                     <p>The King with his potent Army might have quel'd all before him; but through his love to peace, and careleſneſs, he loſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; allowed of a Conference, where it was concluded, that every man ſhould lay down his Arms, and return home; a Truce to continue for five Months, and that in the mean time Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhould treat of a Peace.</p>
                     <p>Thus the King loſt his cauſe; his Army by his negligence waſting and ſlipping away. Nor did the Confederates disband according to promiſe; <hi>De Villena</hi> watching all occaſions to ſee if he could get the credulous King into his clutches. In the mean time <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> led a miſerable life with the Leaguers; and ſuſpecting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their bad intentions, or the ſucceſs of his cauſe, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have agreed with King <hi>Henry,</hi> and go to him; but they kept him ſtrictly, threatning to <note n="a" place="margin">Petiturum veneno, niſi r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> having by his marrying with <hi>Iſabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Authority and Dominions, as alſo by his baniſhing the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſubduing the <hi>Moores</hi> to him in <hi>Granado,</hi> made his Government more ſecure; caſt many a greedy <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>At laſt opportunity (good enough, as he thought) offer'd it ſelf, which was thus:</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II. (a zealous Hotſpur) falling out with <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. King of <hi>France; Fernando</hi> ſides with the Pope, and having rais'd an Army, not onely demands paſſage for it through <hi>Albrets</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, but the command of his ſtrongeſt Caſtles and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and, which was moſt, the poſſeſſion and cuſtody of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> eldeſt ſon to <hi>Navar;</hi> and all theſe as a ſecurity of <hi>Albrets</hi> good behaviour to him; and to be reſtored again, when <hi>Ferdinando</hi> thought good.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>John</hi> thought theſe demands unreaſonable, juſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a difficulty of ever outing the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> if they were once ſo ſtrongly ſetled in his Dominions: eſpecially at this time, when the Factions of the two Families <hi>Gramont</hi> and <hi>Beaumont</hi> had made ſome diſturbance with him at home, and the laſt of them wiſhing too well to <hi>Fernando.</hi> Add to this, there was no neceſſity of ſuch demands for paſſage, ſeeing they might march ſeveral ways into <hi>France</hi> without troubling <hi>Navar.</hi> Thus <hi>Albret</hi> fearing the worſt, by ſmelling out the deſigne, thought to ſtrengthen himſelf by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſts with the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                     <p>The backwardneſs of <hi>Navar</hi> being known, Pope <hi>Julio</hi> falls a <hi>Bulling,</hi> with the conſent of his Cardinals, declaring <hi>John d'Albret</hi> and <hi>Catherine</hi> his Wife, with their Poſterity, for <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> ſo <hi>deprived</hi> of all <hi>Royal Dignity</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> freely giving their Kingdom and Dominions to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> or any that will take the pains to have them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferdinand</hi> now thinking that the Popes <hi>bleſſing</hi> and <hi>curſing</hi> gave him right and title good enough to the Kingdom: And having his Army ready in <hi>Alava</hi> (a little Province between <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var)</hi> made it march on a ſudden under the command of <hi>Don Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drique de Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> Grand-father to <hi>Don Fernando d'Alvarez de Toledo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> ſo noted in the Netherlandiſh Hiſtories, and who after that, in a little time conquer'd <hi>Portugal</hi> to the obedience of his Maſter <hi>Philip</hi> II. For the Narrative of which, I ſhall refer thoſe that deſire to read it, to <hi>Jeronimo Coneſtaggio</hi> of <hi>Genuoa.</hi> But the <hi>Portugais</hi> 1640 make quicker work in regaining of it from <hi>Philip</hi> IV.

                     <p>Thus the Kingdom of <hi>Navar</hi> became an eaſie prey to <hi>Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> from which time it hath continued an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> whilſt the <hi>French</hi> are forced to be content with its empty title.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Albret,</hi> though he was a lover of ſplendour and learning, himſelf being well skill'd in Heraldry, and a great Collector of Books for his Libraries; yet he made himſelf <hi>cheap,</hi> by being two good-natur'd, and too familiar even with the meaneſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſo that, when it came to a ſtreſs, his former freedom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his name of Majeſty contemptible.

                     <p>To theſe we might add the Factions amongſt the Nobility; but that which was the fountain of all, was his giving of himſelf up ſo much to his <note n="a" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Michel Baudier</hi> Hiſt. du Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> pag. 106, 107.</note> pleaſures, that he wholly neglected the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not troubling himſelf with the management of any thing in it; nor caring how things went right or wrong, ſo they would but let him alone to his own fancie; ſo thus (like ſome other Kings) he had the Title, others the ſway and Authority: ſo that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loſt nothing by the want of theſe his Dominions, ſeeing he carryed the name of King along with him, whilſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> took the trouble and care of Government upon him.

                  </head>
                  <p>TO relate at large all the troubles of <hi>Spain,</hi> would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, eſpecially thoſe agitated againſt the famous Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> whilſt he govern'd thoſe Dominions.</p>
                  <p>This great Miniſter of State, of the Family of the <hi>Ciſneres,</hi> was firſt Chriſtned <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> which afterwards in his Cloyſter he changed to <hi>Francis:</hi> being a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> by Order, firſt he ſtudyed at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caela de Henares,</hi> then read the Laws at <hi>Salamanca:</hi> for ſome time acted as an Advocate in the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> In ſhort, he grew ſo famous for his learning and integrity, that he roſe to be Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> got a Cardinals Hat, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all <hi>Spain</hi> to be in his hands.</p>
                  <p>This Grandeur from a mean beginning, procured him no ſmall envy and ill-will from many of the Nobility; but he kept his ground, nor would he loſe an inch of his Authority: he was civil where he met with civility; but was ſo great a friend to Juſtice, that he would not let the Laws be like Spiders webs, for he made no diſtinction, the greateſt Grandee lying as open to Chaſtiſement, as the meaneſt Vaſſal.</p>
                  <p>It would be too tedious to relate how he reduced the revolted <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Granada;</hi> how he conquer'd <hi>Merſalcabir</hi> and <hi>Oran</hi> in <hi>Africa:</hi> the latter of which they ſay was not acted without ſome miracles; as how a <hi>Croſs</hi> appear'd to them at their landing, and that the Sun ſtood ſtill for above four hours, as an Aſſiſtant and Spectator of their Victory.</p>
                  <p>At home he was ever now and anon allarm'd with Conſpiracies and Seditions, but ſtill he was himſelf undaunted and victorious. One of the firſt who flew out, was <hi>Don Pedro Portocarrero,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke <hi>Del Eſcalona,</hi> who made ſome diſturbance to make himſelf Grand Maſter of St. <hi>Jago;</hi> but this uproar the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal over-topt. The next was more formidable, the Ring-leader being <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> eldeſt ſon to the Earl <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>regna,</hi> who by force of Arms would ſeiſe upon the Dukedom of <hi>Medina Sidonia;</hi> and in this he was ſeconded by many of the chief Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But this was alſo quell'd by the prudence of out Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.</p>
                  <p>But that which threatned him moſt, was the inſurrections of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and the other chief Cities in <hi>Old Caſtile,</hi> perſwaded to this Revolt by many of the Nobles; I, ſo zealous were they, that they mounted their Cannons, fortified themſelves, crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſtreets—<hi>This is againſt</hi> Ximenes <hi>the peoples Tyrant:</hi> But this faction he alſo over-topt; yet he is not quiet, for thoſe of <hi>Malaga</hi> mutiny, beat out the Judges and the Admiralty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

                  <p>This he alſo ſuppreſt, as he did the Sedition of D. <hi>John Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſques</hi> of <hi>Cuellor,</hi> who would right or wrong keep the Town or <hi>Arevalo:</hi> Nor did it fare any better with thoſe Noblemen, who had affronted the Cardinal, and violated all juſtice in <hi>Villefratre;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> contention for the Priory of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> came little better off, being conquer'd, and forced to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, this great Cardinal held up his head againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and the better to ſtrengthen his Authority, he firſt rais'd in <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Train-bands,</hi> conſiſting of above thirty thouſand ſubſtantial houſe-holders, all which he had ready at a ſmall warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And though many dependants of the Nobility, who muſt follow their Lords Example, hated him, yet never was there any favorite in all <hi>Spain</hi> better beloved then he, by the generality of people; ſuch was his impartiality to Juſtice, Charity to the Poor, and care for the well-fare and honour of his Maſter and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                  <p>One time, ſome of the diſcontented Nobility deſired to know by what right he acted as he did; the Cardinal replyed, <hi>By the will and power of his Catholick Majeſty.</hi> This not ſatisfying, he ſhew'd them his <hi>Guards;</hi> then ſhewing his <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Girdle, and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And in this he was as good as his word. King <hi>Charles</hi> arrived in the <hi>Aſturias</hi> in <note n="a" place="margin">1517.</note> 
                     <hi>September,</hi> and the Cardinal dyed in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> alter, not without a grand ſuſpition of poyſon: he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>And thus much in ſhort of this great Cardinal, of whom you may ſee more in <hi>Alvaro Gomez,</hi> and <hi>Michael Baudier;</hi> the firſt having writ his life at large in <hi>Latine,</hi> and the other in <hi>French:</hi> who in him endeavours to pattern out an exact Miniſter of State, to the great Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu:</hi> Nor doth envie it ſelf finde any fault in him, but that ſome fancie him to be one too lofty, and one that could not brook an oppoſition; qualifications which ſome think agreeable enough with a Governour.</p>

                  <p>Of the Forraigners <hi>Guillermo de Crouy</hi> Lord of <hi>Xeures</hi> or <hi>Cheures</hi> [Duke of <hi>Sora</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and of <hi>Arſchot</hi> in <hi>Brabant]</hi> was the chiefeſt favourite, and indeed ſway'd the King and Kingdom as he pleas'd; and in his actions was ſo partial and covetous, that he became abominable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who for his faults leſſen'd their Affection and Loyalty to their King. And here, by the way, take one merry and inſtructive ſtory of a favourite.</p>
                  <p>A Petitioner having preſented this <hi>Xeures</hi> with an handſome Mule with rich Furniture, that his deſire might be the ſooner granted: <hi>Xeures</hi> being asked preſently by another Gentleman, where he had got that curious Beaſt, replyed, <hi>He knew not.</hi> The poor Petitioner being by, and ſeeing himſelf ſo ſoon forgotten, and ſo his buſineſs neglected, went his ways; and orders his Mule to be cryed, declaring all her Marks and Furniture. Which the other Gentleman hearing, went preſently and told <hi>Xeures,</hi> that according to the Marks it muſt needs be, that this Mule had been ſtoln: by which device the poor Petitioner recovered his Mule, which he had given before to ſmall purpoſe. Thus much for <hi>Cheures,</hi> though related to the Royal Bloud of <hi>Hungary,</hi> yet baſe, cruel and covetous; as moſt Favourites are, by ſuch vices getting their preferments: All ſuch grand Flatterers, Pimps and Pick-thanks, being the greateſt bane and curſe that can happen to a King and Kingdom.</p>

Though he promiſed a return after he had received the Imperial Crown; <hi>Germany</hi> now falling into ſome diſtractions by reaſon of his abſence. From St. <hi>Jago, Charles</hi> goeth to <hi>Corunna</hi> (or the <hi>Groyne)</hi> where the Commiſſioners of the Kingdoms go alſo; and at laſt, moſt of them grant him ſome monies, for which they got no thanks from their Cities.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Toledo</hi> falls into diſtractions; the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their troubles being <hi>Hernando de Avalos,</hi> and <hi>Don Juan de Padilla,</hi> with his high-ſpirited wife <hi>Donna Maria Pacheco,</hi> all of good Families; who fill'd the peoples heads full of many whimſies.

Upon which, the hired Rabble came and ſeiſed upon them, declaring they would not part with ſuch good Commonwealths men; ſo carryed them to a Chappel, where they made them promiſe not to go to the Emperour; though the other ſeem'd teeth-forward ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to proteſt againſt ſuch dealings, and that they were willing to obey the Emperour. This done, the people made the Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governor of <hi>Toledo, Don Antonio de Cordova,</hi> to approve their actions, and to forbid their friends to go to Court.</p>
                  <p>The miſchief being gone thus far, <hi>Hernando de Avalos</hi> and <hi>Juan de Padilla</hi> puſh them on farther; for which they had the Fryars and Prieſts at their ſervice, who in their Pulpits incenſed the people to the purpoſe, who according as they were inſtigated, (though with the loſs of ſome bloud) ſeiſe upon the Gates, Bridges, and

                  <p>The Emperour being at <hi>Corunna,</hi> and fitting for his departure, news comes to him of theſe Tumults of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which did not a little trouble him; but hoping that as their beginning was in haſte, ſo they would not laſt long.

                  <p>The Emperour before his departure had made Governour or Vice-roy Cardinal <hi>Adrian,</hi> who had been formerly his Tutor, and was afterwards Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI, for he would not change his name according to the cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Emperours departure, the Nobility and Gentry which waited upon him as far as the ſea-ſide, return'd to their own houſes, and the Commiſſioners or Burgeſſes to their reſpective Cities; and the Cardinal took his way towards <hi>Valladolid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now began the people to be ſtark mad, and the City of <hi>Segovia</hi> led the way; and thus it was: It is a cuſtom in <hi>Segovia</hi> every <hi>Tueſday</hi> in <hi>Whitſon-week,</hi> that the Collectors meet to treat concerning the Revenue of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Church. Here being now met, one of them falls a railing againſt the Governour of the City; for which raſhneſs he was warily reprehended by one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> which reproof was ſo ill taken by the people, who alſo hated <hi>Melon</hi> for his Office, being a Sergeant, that in a fury they took the poor <hi>Catch-pole,</hi> threw a Rope about his neck, and dragg'd him out of the City, with a deſigne to hang him; but they bruis'd him with ſo many ſtripes, that he was dead before they got him to the Gallows, however they hung up his body there.</p>
                  <p>This done, as they return'd, they met with a Companion of <hi>Melon's,</hi> called <hi>Roque Portalejo,</hi> whom without farther ado, they hal'd to the Gallows, hanging him up by the feet till he dyed. The next day being informed that their Alderman and Burgeſs <hi>Antonio de Tordeſillas,</hi> had granted the Emperour ſome monies, and was then at the Town-Council; thither they ran in an hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, climbing over the Doors, breaking in at the Windows; and violently laying hands on him, they dragged him out of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels</hi> Church (where the Council meets) nor could all his intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and reaſons ſatisfie them, but they ſet him clad in crimſon Velvet on a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This done, they turn'd out all the Kings Officers of Juſtice, putting others in their places, and ruled all, having ſeiſed on the City Gates: but the Forts were gallantly defended
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:109877:196"/> by <hi>Don Hernando de Bobadilla,</hi> Earl of <hi>Chinchon,</hi> and his brother <hi>Don Diego.</hi> And the chiefeſt of the City endeavour'd to excuſe themſelves to the Cardinal and his Council.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time with the former tumult, the City of <hi>Zamora</hi> fell into the like fury againſt their Commiſſioners and Burgeſſes for granting the Emperour a Subſidy: whereupon the Members fled, and hid themſelves in the Monaſtery of <hi>Marta,</hi> a little days journey off; which ſo inraged the people, that they made Statues and Pictures reſembling them, which they dragged about the ſtreets with many reproachful exclamations; and threatned the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to fire it, if the Commiſſioners were not deliver'd, whom they reſolved to murther.</p>
                  <p>The people of <hi>Vall adolid</hi> had the ſame freaks in their noddles: But thoſe of <hi>Burgos</hi> could not be kept within any bounds, aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Conſtables houſe, invironed the houſe of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs <hi>Donna Maria de Tabar,</hi> ſhooting down part of its Tower, whereby they entred, and ſought for her; but ſhe ſaved her ſelf by hiding. They ran to <hi>Garci Ruiz de la Mota's</hi> houſe (who had been Commiſſioner, and was Brother to the Biſhop of <hi>Bada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jos</hi> and <hi>Palencia)</hi> reſolving to kill him; but he ſaved himſelf by flight; yet they burn'd his houſe, with a great number of Deeds, Charters, and other Papers belonging to the King and Kingdom. Nor did they ſpare the conſuming of his richeſt goods and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; as fine Linnen, rich Tapiſtry-hangings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all which they made a great Bonfire to ſatisfie their fury, and make their worſhips ſport. And to continue the Frolick, they burned down the Houſe of <hi>Garci Jofre,</hi> one of the Emperours Harbingers; and not content with this, they took the poor fellow, clapt him in Priſon, where with blows and thruſts they ſoon diſpatch'd him; and being dead, they tyed his feet together, ſo drag'd him to his own door, cutting and pinking his body with their ſwords all the way: and thus drawing it through all the ſtreets, at laſt they hang'd it up with his head downwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madrid</hi> was alſo poſſeſt with the ſame Devil of Rebellion, ſeiſing upon all the Arms, and ſetting Guards to maintain their own whims all the City over: and in like manner roſe up <hi>Siguenza, Salamanca, Murcia, Illeſcas;</hi> and as mad as the reſt was <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lajara,</hi> who not being able to get their Commiſſioners into their Clutches, raſed down their houſes; the foundations of which they plowed up, and ſowed with ſalt, ſaying that,—<hi>In regard they were traytors houſes, they must be ſalted, leſt they ſhould infect the reſt with their infidelity.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Adrian</hi> and his Council having conſider'd of theſe diſtempers, reſolved by puniſhing of <hi>Segovia</hi> to terrifie the reſt: to which purpoſe they ſent as Judge <hi>Ronquillo,</hi> a famous Lawyer in thoſe times, with a thouſand horſe for his ſecurity; and if the City denyed him entrance, and to be judged by him, to make his way by ſorce. The <hi>Segovians</hi> upon this fortifie themſelves, and make reſiſtance, being aſſiſted by thoſe of <hi>Toledo, Avila,</hi> &amp; <hi>Madrid,</hi> with other inferiour Towns, whereby ſeveral skirmiſhes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Cardinal, upon this, orders <hi>Antonio de Fonceca</hi> (Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General of the Kingdom) to go to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ronquillo.

                  <p>The Citizens of <hi>Medina</hi> inraged at the burning of their houſes, flew to Arms, elected one <hi>Bobadilla,</hi> a furious Cloth-worker their Captain, under whoſe conduct they preſently deſtroy'd all they could meet with, that had any familiarity or kindneſs with <hi>Fonceca;</hi> againſt whom they ſent their complaints to the other Cities.</p>
                  <p>At this, the Citizens of <hi>Valladolid</hi> fell ſtark mad, ran in a fury to <hi>Pedro de Portillo's</hi> houſe (the chief and richeſt there) which they plundred and pull'd down; the like they did to General <hi>Fonceca</hi>'s houſe, and the habitation of <hi>Alonſo Ninno de Caſtro</hi> their chief Judge; and turn'd out of their City <hi>Don Alonſo En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſma,</hi> and other Gentlemen, whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed would not be partakers with them: the reſt they made take an <hi>Ingagement</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> to their <hi>Holy Commonalty.</hi>

                  <p>The Emperour thinking to quiet all, by taking away their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the Cardinal who was a ſtranger, orders <hi>Don Inigo de Velaſco,</hi> Lord high Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> and <hi>Don Fadrique Enriquez,</hi> Lord Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to be in joynt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Authority with <hi>Adrian</hi> in the Government; but all would not do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Junta</hi> having now the weak-brain'd <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> at their diſpoſal, lookt upon themſelves as great enough to act any thing; ſo they turn out thoſe who were about her that favour'd the Emperour. Then they ſend a <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryar to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> who from the Pulpit of <hi>St. Maria la Mayor,</hi> perſwaded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſeiſe upon the Kings Council there, declaring it unfitting that they ſhould ſit in oppoſition to the <hi>holy Junta:</hi> the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at this were a little divided; however they concluded, that they themſelves would not lay hands on the Council-Royal (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dangerous conſequence,) but if the <hi>Junta,</hi> (which they would not diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Junta</hi> informed of this anſwer, ſent Dr. <hi>Alonſo de Medina</hi> a <hi>Franciſean,</hi> who being come to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> deſired the people to meet him at the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> where, in the Pulpit, he renew'd the old requeſt, that the <hi>Royal Council</hi> might be ſeiſed on, and ſent priſoners to <hi>Tordeſillas;</hi> telling them, that there were ſouldiers without the City to act it. To this the Citizens agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the next day <hi>Juan de Padilla</hi> enters the City with above a thouſand men, ſeis'd on all the Council he could finde, with the Books of the Treaſury, and the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> all which he carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Tordeſillas:</hi> Yet would not the Citizens let Cardinal <hi>Adrian</hi> be affronted, whom they look'd upon as an holy and good man. But he conſidering the unconſtancie of the people, thought good to conſult his own ſafety; for which endeavouring once publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to withdraw himſelf, the Citizens in a tumultuous manner ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and forced him to retire to his Lodgings, whence not long after in a diſguiſe he <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Junta</hi> was not idle, having over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the craſie Queen-Mother <hi>Donna Juana</hi> to head and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them, and appointed her a Council out of themſelves to adviſe her, which got them no ſmall repute amongſt the vulgar, which was preſt home to the purpoſe by the ſeditious <hi>Fryars.</hi> And having thus conſtituted themſelves Supreme, they ſent a large <note n="a" place="margin">Dated at <hi>Tordeſillas, Octob.</hi> 20. 1520</note> Paper of <hi>Propoſitions</hi> (ſome of them very extravagant and pernicious) to the Emperour, to have him declare them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Laws: but <hi>Charles</hi> needed neither ſuch Governours nor Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>And now the ſword muſt decide the quarrel; the <hi>Junta</hi> raiſe men on all hands, ſeiſeth upon the Kings Revenues to pay them; Proclaim the <hi>Lord high Conſtable,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Royaliſts Traytors,</hi> and all their Eſtates forfeited; wrote Letters to all the Cities and Towns of their faction, to encourage them to Arms; nay, and ſent to <hi>Don Manuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> thinking to gain him to their party.

                     <hi>Diſguiſed man,</hi> and one ſent from God to their relief.</p>
                  <p>But what this Impoſtor was, take thus. He was the Son of a <hi>Jew,</hi> and was carryed by his Father into <hi>Barbary</hi> the ſame year that the <hi>Jews</hi> were driven out of <hi>Castile.</hi> A <hi>Biſcan</hi> Merchant, call'd <hi>Juan de Bilbao,</hi> met with him on ſhip board 1512, as he was trading to <hi>Oran</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and finding him to write and read well, and ſpeak ſeveral Languages, as <hi>Spaniſh, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> took him for his Factor. The fellow calling himſelf from his Maſters name <hi>Juan de Bilbao,</hi> with him he lived four years, till 1516 he turn'd him away for being too familiar with his Wife.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corregidor,</hi> or <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Oran,</hi> not knowing the ſault, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him for his Steward. This Mayor of <hi>Oran</hi> being a young man kept privately a little wanton in his houſe, to whom this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhew'd much affection and Courtſhip; but ſhe being truſty to her Maſter, tells him all, and that he alſo perſwaded her to witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. Upon this the <hi>Corregidor</hi> hath him impriſoned, and upon a Market-day ſet upon an Aſs, and ſo whipt through all the principal ſtreets of the City, to the amazement of the people, who had a good opinion of him, ſo cunningly did he carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Being thus baniſh'd <hi>Oran,</hi> he returns for <hi>Spain,</hi> lands upon the Coaſts of <hi>Valencia</hi> (juſt in theſe diſtractions) under the name of <hi>Don Henrique Manrique de Ribera;</hi> and here he behaved himſelf ſo cunningly, taking hold of the opportunity, that at laſt he made the people believe that he was their true King, and for ſuch they acknowledged him.</p>
                  <p>He carryed his buſineſs politickly, kept correſpondence with divers Cities in <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and might have given a main ſtroak for the whole Kingdom, had not the valiant and loyal Marquiſs of <hi>Cenete,</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro Faxardo</hi> the Governour or Lord-lieutenant <hi>[Adelantado Mayor]</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> with other noble <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> by their valour and induſtry put a ſtop to his carreer. The chiefeſt loſs to the Rebels was in <hi>Valencia</hi> it ſelf, where <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> had almoſt carryed the whole City: but the Marquiſs here carryed himſelf ſo cunningly, that he out-braved the Rebel, making moſt of his followers disband and retire to their own dwellings. This day and plot was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to that City, that to this time, 'tis call'd the <hi>Thurſday of Vicente Periz:</hi> yet <hi>Periz</hi> received freſh ſupplies from <hi>Juan de Bilvao,</hi> with which he grew ſo hardy, that he fought <hi>de Cenete</hi> in the very ſtreets of the City, though to his own ruine, being beaten, himſelf taken, and his head preſently ſtruck off. After which the Impoſtor Kingling <hi>John of Bilbao</hi> was alſo taken by the Marqueſs, the nineteenth of <hi>May</hi> 1522. who, according to his deſert, was drawn, hang'd and quarter'd, and his head ſtuck upon a Lance. After which, <hi>Valencia</hi> began to be more quiet, and wholly ſubmitted themſelves upon the return of the Emperour <hi>Charles.</hi> And thus much, in brief, for the Rebellion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Valencia;</hi> not to tell of all their Church-robbings, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, Burnings, Devaſtations, and Factions even in the very Cloiſters and Monaſteries themſelves, inſomuch that one party in the ſame Covent would pray to God for the King, whilſt the other pray'd as heartily for the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>But now to return to the <hi>Junta</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> we finde their Army (conſiſting of ſeventeen thouſand foot, beſides good ſtore of Horſe and Artillery) <hi>(b)</hi> march'd into the field, with an intent to <note place="margin">

                  <p>One of the moſt furious ſticklers for the <hi>Junta</hi> againſt his King, was <hi>Don Antonio de Acunna,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zamora</hi> (one who had formerly been honour'd with an Embaſſie into <hi>France.)</hi> He was threeſcore years old, but lively and vigorous, and excellent in handling his Arms; he had above four hundred Prieſts under his command in this Rebellion, well armed and ſtout, himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways charging at the head of them, crying out, <hi>Here my Prieſts!</hi> And if he ſaw but any of them <hi>(c)</hi> handle or read on his <hi>Breviary</hi>

                  <p>Between the two Armies there were now and then ſome skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes; but the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> thought it no wiſdom to put it to a main Battel, their enemies being double the number; beſides, they had ſome underhand dealings with ſome Chieftains of the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> which made the Rebels too negligent, and retire into Quarters: Upon which opportunity, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> on a ſudden march'd to <hi>Tordeſillas,</hi> which with the loſs of ſome bloud they took; and here the Biſhops Prieſts fought it out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tordeſillus</hi> thus taken, the Nobility waited upon the Queen-mother, who received them kindly, not that ſhe cared how things went, being indiſpoſed in her ſenſes, from underſtanding what was either good or bad for the publick, though the <hi>Junta,</hi> to delude the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> gave out that ſhe was not onely well in her wits, but fit for Government, and that ſhe had taken it upon her, and acknowledged their intereſt; and accordingly they acted all things in her name, not mentioning the King. Here ſome of the <hi>Junta</hi> were taken, others eſcaped; and the honour of this exploit was juſtly thrown upon the Earl of <hi>Haro</hi> the Kings Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>The taking of <hi>Tordeſillas</hi> did not a little terrifie <hi>Valladolid,</hi> whither the remaining part of the <hi>Junta</hi> fled and ſate in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and the people now growing jealous of <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> choſe <hi>Juan de Padilla</hi> for their Captain General, who proſecuted the Rebellion more vigorouſly then the former.</p>

                  <p>By this time, ſome of the <hi>Junta</hi> were willing to ſee their errour, <label type="milestone">

And in truth, the City of <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladolid,</hi> and ſome other places for the <hi>Commonalty</hi> had ſuffer'd very much, all Trade being ſpoil'd, Corn very dear, their monies all gone in paying the Souldiers, and no ſafety for any without the venturing of blows.</p>
                  <p>And now the fatal day drew near. <hi>Juan de Padilla</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was in <hi>Torrelobaton</hi> (where he had trifled away too much time) The <hi>Royaliſts</hi> march towards him, thinking either to beſiege him, or force him to battel, before he could get any more ſuccour; the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> being towards 10000 men, and the <hi>Commonalty</hi> at that place almoſt nine thouſand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Padilla</hi> informed of the deſigne, was reſolved not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; ſo, drew out his men, intending for <hi>Toro,</hi> there to ſtay till more ſuccours came to him. The <hi>Royaliſts</hi> having notice of his private march, mend their pace; now and then skirmiſhing them, till they come neer to <hi>Villalar</hi> (a Town in <hi>Leon</hi> between <hi>Medina de Reoſeco</hi> and <hi>Tordeſillas)</hi> where they fell upon them in three ſeveral bodies; and preſently putting them to the rout, the purſuit being ſeveral miles, in which many of the <hi>Commonalty</hi> were ſlain.</p>
                  <p>This victory was gain'd on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> word was <note n="b" place="margin">Sancta <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> y <hi>Carlos.</hi>

                  <p>The Army of the <hi>Commonalty</hi> being thus routed, the <hi>Junta</hi> which was in <hi>Valladolid</hi> ſneak'd away: The City it ſelf ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, which was graciouſly pardon'd, though they had been the chief maintainers of the Rebellion.

                  <p>But <hi>Toledo</hi> would be brought to no reaſon; the chief Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of that City being <hi>Donna Maria Pacheco Mendoza,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Tendilla,</hi> and wife to <hi>Don Juande Padilla</hi> (lately beheaded) a Lady of a daring and reſolute ſpirit, wherefore ſhe was generally call'd <hi>The valiant woman (La Muger valeroſa)</hi> and to excite the Citizens to compaſſion, ſhe made her Son be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed up and down the ſtreets on a Mule with a mourning hood and Cloak on, and a Streamer with the Picture of her husband <hi>Padilla</hi> beheaded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> did not queſtion, if they could either get her
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109877:200"/> out of the City, or to joyn with them, to reduce the place to his Majeſty; to effect which, they ſent a Captain (who freely offer'd himſelf) with a few men diſguiſed thither: Being arrived at <hi>Toledo,</hi> he went directly to the Fort where ſhe was, deſiring to ſpeak with her: But the people having ſome notice of the deſigne, made an Alarm, and ran in great multitudes to the Caſtle, where finding the Captain in diſcourſe with her, they preſently laid hands on him, and flung him out of the high window; by which fall he was broke all to pieces. This done, they cut the throats of all thoſe who came along with him.</p>
                  <p>And now they reſolve to fortifie themſelves againſt all attempts; fill'd their ſtores full, took all the gold and ſilver plate out of the Cathedral Church, which they coyned; and they were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle animated by the coming of the <hi>French,</hi> who taking opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe troubles, enter'd <hi>Navar,</hi> thinking to regain that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but all to no purpoſe: and ſo at laſt the <hi>Toledians</hi> were brought to better terms, and received into mercy: <hi>Donna Maria Pacheco</hi> being forced for her own ſafety, in a Country-womans diſguiſe, riding upon an Aſs with ſome Geeſe in her hands, to eſcape out of the City, living the reſt of her days in Exile, and as ſome think dying in <hi>Portugal.</hi> And now for Example was the houſe of <hi>Juan de Padilla</hi> pull'd down to the ground, the foundation of it plow'd up and ſowed with ſalt, that the ſoyl where the Chieftain of ſo great troubles and miſchiefs had his birth and habitation, ſhould not produce ſo much as graſs or weeds; and a Pillar was erected there, with an Inſcription declaring the manner of his life and death.</p>
                  <p>And now all is reduced to obedience, the Emperour returns to <hi>Spain,</hi> (having received the Imperial Crown) and on a Scaffold cover'd with Cloth of Gold and Silk, erected in the chief Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place in <hi>Valladolid,</hi> the Emperour himſelf with his <note n="a" place="margin">They are ſo call'd, whom the King gives leave to ſtand covered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.

                  <p>The ſurpriſal of theſe Letters diſcover'd all, and ſpoil'd the deſigne. <hi>David Graham</hi> of <hi>Fintrie</hi> was tryed and found guilty, and <note n="b" place="margin">15 or 16 of <hi>February</hi> 1592.</note> beheaded in the High-ſtreet of <hi>Edinbrough.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> having been imploy'd by the King (who then doubted not of his loyalty) to quiet ſome troubles in the <hi>North,</hi> not knowing any thing of the ſeiſing of <hi>Kar,</hi> and the diſcovery of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> deſigne, returns to <hi>Edinbrough,</hi> where he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently arreſted by the <note n="c" place="margin">The Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> Provoſt and <hi>(c)</hi> Bayliffs of the City, and ſent priſoner to the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>But from this impriſonment he eſcapes, flees into the <hi>North,</hi> joyns himſelf with <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arrol,</hi> and raiſe what Forces they can. But upon the report of the Kings marching againſt them, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1593</label> they fled into the Mountains; and ſeeing no other help, ſent their Ladies to the King to intercede for them: the King tells them, he will ſhew them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what favour he can, but adviſeth them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a tryal.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Presbyterian Kirk</hi> grow very mally part, and a Club of their Miniſters being jumbled together on their own heads, they forſooth would condomn them; and ſo they Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Earls of <hi>Anguſs, Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arrol,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Cheſholme;</hi> nor could the King by all his Authority and deſires, get the Brethren to forbear or ſtay the publication of their ſentence. Though the Earls had waited upon the King, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves, and deſired a Trial.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, the Popiſh Lords gave no ſignes of real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: no, though the King had uſed divers means to gain them, and was willing to wink at their paſt crimes, upon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their good behaviour for the future, yet all his Majeſties endeavours were in vain, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> prevailing too much over them with their bad counſels, and feeding them daily with hopes of forraign aid. No, though the King through love exhorted them to enter themſelves in cuſtody (to pleaſure the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and make ſome ſignes of a tryal) would they give any obedience to the Kings deſires.</p>
                  <p>Theſe contempts rendring them more odious, a Parliament is held, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Lords brought to Tryal, and are found <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Yet the King had ſome favour for them; but they grow worſe and worſe: for joyning themſelves with the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> they make a Covenant or Bond amongſt themſelves at the Church of <hi>Memmore,</hi> and ſo flee to Arms; the main ſtickler in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being Sir <hi>James Douglas</hi> of <hi>Spot.</hi> And opportunately to aſſiſt them, arrives a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship at <hi>Montroſe,</hi> which brought ſome gold for their ſupplies.</p>
                  <p>The King informed of all by the apprehenſion of <hi>Allan Orme,</hi> ſervant to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> ſends <hi>Argile</hi> Northwards to quell them: <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi> gets an Army of 10000 men, but <note n="a" place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Clenlivat, October</hi> 3.</note> are beat by 900 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Huntley,</hi> who here loſt his Uncle of <hi>Achindown,</hi> and <hi>Arrol</hi> was ſore wounded in his armand leg.</p>
                  <p>But for all this, the Confederate Lords at the long run were ſo put to it, that they deſired liberty to depart the Kingdom, giving ſecurity to practice no more againſt the King or Religion: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they went, and <hi>Bothwell</hi> ſteals into <hi>France,</hi> thence into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> where he lived miſerably, and dyed beggerly, about the year 1624.</p>
                  <p>The baniſh'd Lords, not finding themſelves in that favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas as they expected, reſolve to return home; <hi>Huntley</hi> ſteals <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Huntley</hi> for ſome time keeps off the conditions, the <hi>Kirk</hi> being his enemy. And his Uncle <hi>James Gordon</hi> the Jeſuit came into the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1597</label> Country to perſwade him from any reconcilement; but at laſt, not onely he, but <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arrol</hi> ſubmit, ſubſcribe to the Faith of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are abſolved at <hi>Aberdene</hi> from their former Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and received into grace and favour of the King.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time there was diſcovered a deſigne to fortifie the Iſle of <hi>Elſay,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> Seas. This Iſland is a great Rock, four miles in compaſs, wherein an old ruinous Tower is built on the ſteep aſcent of the Rock: the plot was, that by ſeiſing on the Iſland, the Forces that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King had promis'd to ſend, might here be received.</p>
                  <p>The main actor in this, was <hi>Hugh Barklay</hi> Laird of <hi>Lady-land,</hi> who having been the year before committed in the Caſtle of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> had made an eſcape and fled to <hi>Spain;</hi> and this year re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to purſue his old deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Having got ſome followers, he enters the Iſland, with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have well victual'd it. But Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> (the ſame who took <hi>Ker)</hi> underſtanding his purpoſe, gets haſtily a company of men, and makes towards the Iſle. Moſt of <hi>Barklays</hi> men were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imploy'd, dreaming of no ſuch thing; and himſelf not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his plot was known, did not take <hi>Knox</hi> his men (though he ſaw them coming) for enemies: thus careleſs, <hi>Knox</hi> lands, and encounters him on the very ſhore; upon which <hi>Barklay</hi> reſolved not to be taken, runs into the Sea and drowns himſelf: and ſo there is an end of him and the Popiſh troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> for this time.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As for King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, it fareth with him as with other Princes, moſt ſpeaking of him as their intereſt lay; being honour'd by ſome with as great Commendations as Fancie or Flattery could reach, whilſt by others he was look'd upon as the worſt of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and loaded with all the Reproaches and Infamies that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr or Malice could invent: for as the worſt of Kings and Actions will never want Flatterers and admirers, ſo the beſt will never eſcape the ſlanders of the envious.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, though he was Learned above the cuſtom of Princes; yet if ever any man had his faults, our <hi>Henry</hi> had his ſhare to the purpoſe: his <hi>Will</hi> being both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as far as his Dominions reacht; and to contradict his humour, was little leſs then to be next door to another world; and which might make him worſe, was, that amongſt all his Favourites and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, there was ſcarce any, but either Knave or Flatterer, if not both, ſince 'tis hard to ſeparate them. So that in many things where that King did amiſs, whether he acted them by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and judgement, or by the ſuggeſtions and inſtigations of his griping and baſe-ſoul'd Courtiers and Minions, ſhall be left to every ones opinion; nor is it much material where the fault ſhould be laid, being both ſo guilty.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is certain, that when he followed his own proper <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> viz. <hi>Martial exploits,</hi> none came off with greater glory then himſelf for his perſonal Acts and Valour. And the whole
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:109877:221" rendition="simple:additions"/> Kingdom is beholden unto him for the great Fame and Renown ſhe gain'd abroad by her Victories and Warlike Atchievements under his conduct. And what cannot <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> do, under an Active and Martial Prince? But in brief, I ſhall not undertake to quit him from that ſhort but comprehenſive Character given him of old, <hi>viz.</hi>—That <hi>he never ſpared man in his Anger, nor woman in his Luſt.</hi>

                  <p>This he did, he ſaith, the better to inform the ſaid <hi>Aretine</hi> of the Kings worth; telling him alſo, that the King,—<hi>Hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred thee with an honourable Legacie by his Teſtament; the which his Enemies pretend, proceeded of the fear that he had, leſt thou ſhouldſt after his death defame him.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>But certain I am, that the King in his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Teſtament</hi> maketh no mention of this Poet: ſo in this Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> was miſinformed; a thing of no great wonder. And that the King ſtood in any fear of <hi>Aretines</hi> writing againſt him, or that <hi>Aretine</hi> intended to write of him, I cannot ſay: but true it is, that though this <hi>Florentine</hi> was no great Clerk, yet in his Mothers Tongue he laid ſo about him, and with that rage and fury, that he was ſtil'd the <hi>Scourge of Princes;</hi> and his Epitaph in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Church in <hi>Venice</hi> will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell the Temper of the Fellow; in <hi>Italian</hi> I meet with it thus:</p>

                  <p>Having thus ſomewhat hinted on her Commendations, and at laſt brought the Pope himſelf to be an Advocate for her Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prudence and good Government, we may now the more exactly perceive where the Shooe pincheth, and what is the cauſe of the ill will againſt her. Not denying but that ſhe, as well as the beſt of Monarchs, might have ſome miſcarriages and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, in ſuch a long Raign as ſhe continued; eſpecially ſince the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and ſome others, had the Fortune to ſway in her time; it being granted, that <hi>Robert Dudly</hi> was as great an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, as ever breath'd for a Favourite, and ſo let him and all ſuch never be mentioned but with ignominy.</p>
                  <p>As for her Religion, <hi>whether Haeretical or not?</hi> As the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is too large to be here diſcuſs'd; ſo is it nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeeing Religion doth not intitle one to Kingdoms, nor is Dominion founded in Grace; a Pagan having as much right to his Goods and Territories, as the beſt of Chriſtians to what is his.</p>
                  <p>As to her perſonal concerns, no queſtion but ſhe thought her ſelf in the beſt and ſureſt way to her Salvation. And as ſhe was a Princeſs of great Ingenuity and Parts, underſtood many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, read many Books, and was ſo ſtudious as to tranſlate ſome her ſelf out of <hi>Greek, Latine</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> ſo we need not doubt but thus furniſht and induſtrious in Learning, ſhe was able to give a good account of her Religion, and to vindicate it and her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And as for Religion, as it related to the publick, it hath had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Champious and Martyrs to juſtifie it, and to wipe off all the pretended blots of Schiſm and Hereſie, which malice or ignorance could throw upon it; for a farther proof of which [it being not material to my Hiſtory in hand] I ſhall refer the Reader to Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and ſuchlike Learned Defenders of our Church.

                  <p>But waving her Religion, I finde the greateſt crime objected to her, is her cruelty againſt others for their opinions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and with this her Adverſaries have made no little noiſe in the world.</p>

                  <p>To theſe we may add <hi>Richard Verſtegan,</hi> who put forth a Book call'd <hi>Theatrum Crudelitatum Haereticorum Noſtri Temporis:</hi> where, in his Pictures he offers to view the former lying Bear-skin Tales. Of this man (becauſe he afterwards afforded ſome light to Antiquities, and our Hiſtorians are ſilent of his life and extraction) a word or two by the by.</p>
                  <p>His Grand-father was call'd <hi>Theodore Rowland Verſtegan,</hi> born in <hi>Gelder-landt;</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> about the latter end of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII; marryed here, and preſently after dyed, leaving a Son nine months old, who afterwards, to get a livelihood, took upon him the profeſſion of a <hi>Cooper</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Nor is this any diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, <hi>Wolfangus Muſculus</hi> his Father being of that Trade.</p>

                  <p>And here I cannot but take notice of one pretty cheat the Pope makes uſe of, to ſhew to the world his great liking of this Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, <hi>viz.</hi> that whenſoever the famous Catholick <hi>Thuanus</hi> in his Narrative of this Butchery, hints (as he doth ſeveral times) of the cruelty of theſe Throat-cuttings,</p>
                  <p>Theſe expreſſions ſound ſo harſh in the ears of his good <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> that in the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> they are all order'd to be daſht out, and to appear no more in print, leſt good people ſhould be corrupted by them; ſo wo be to them, who dare think amiſs of this <hi>Pariſian</hi> ſlaughter. But it is not here alone, but in many other places, that they have endeavour'd to falſifie and corrupt this Learned <hi>Thuanus,</hi> though one of their own Church, yet one that hated lying. For which <hi>Jacobus Gretſer, Johannes Baptiſta de Machand,</hi> or <hi>Macaldus,</hi> under the falſe name of <hi>Jo. Baptiſta Gallus</hi> I.

                  <p>But leaving theſe forraign compariſons, let us return home, and take a ſhort view of our two Siſter-Queens of different perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Religion.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Piety and Mercie is much commended by <hi>Sanders</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> Reigned about five years; yet in that ſhort time were put to death for Religion above 260, without any regard to Sex, Quality or Age, Rich and Poor, Learned and Ignorant, Old and little Children that knew not the right-hand from the left; one ſpringing out of its Mothers Womb, whilſt burning at the Stake, and unhumanely the little infant thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, to burn with its Heretical Mother, as they term'd it.</p>
                  <p>In twice this time, <hi>viz.</hi> for the firſt ten years of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not one <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſuffer'd death for Religion; and though ſhe Reigned above 44 years, yet in that long Rule, there were not ſo many put to death of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for Treaſon, or what elſe the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> pleaſeth, almoſt by an hundred, as there were in the ſhort time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> To which we may add, as is confeſt by <note n="b" place="margin">In numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles <hi>Ang li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This were enough to teſtifie, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and merciful to her Subjects, as her Siſter Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> And to perſwade thoſe who throw ſo many commendations on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to rob the former of her due praiſe.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1570</label> and yet this was not till the XII year of her Reign: ſo that they can pretend to no bloud for ſo many years. And what ſmall reaſon they have to glory in this mans Martyrdom, let us judge
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:109877:227" rendition="simple:additions"/> by the Cauſe: in ſhort thus; for I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having triumphantly Raigned above X years in the Nation, to the great joy and comfort of her Subjects; at laſt Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V takes a humour in his head, and he, forſooth, muſt declare her to be no Queen; to which purpoſe he thunders out a <hi>Bull,</hi> declaring her <hi>Heretick, Excommunicated, Deprived</hi> and <hi>Depoſed from her Dominions: Abſolves all her Subjects from Allegiance, and interdicts any that ſhall obey her,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Felton</hi> gets this <hi>Bull,</hi> hangs it upon the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-gates, ſcorns to ſeek an eſcape, boldly vindicates the Pope and himſelf in what was done, defying the Queen and her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for which he was arraigned, condemn'd and hang'd, <note place="margin">Auguſt 8.</note> neer the ſame place in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard.</p>
                  <p>Now for any thus to contemn and vilifie his Soveraign, null her Authority, renounce his Allegiance, and ſo far to ſubmit himſelf to a Forreign juriſdiction even in Temporalities, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his own Soveraign deprived and depos'd from her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; I ſay, what puniſhment this man incur'd, let the Reader judge; provided he will alſo conſider, that had a Proteſtant thus renounced his Obedience in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days (not but that there were ſome <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> fire-brands then) the party ſhould have dyed for it; and thoſe who commend <hi>Felton,</hi> would have call'd the other Traytor. And yet <hi>Felton</hi> did it to procure a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>This and ſome other Diſturbances, occaſioned the next <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to put forth ſome <note n="a" place="margin">13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 1. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Acts</hi> for the preſervation of the Queens perſon, and the better quieting and ſecuring her Subjects and Dominions; all people having time given them to conſult either their own ſafety, or a complyance. So that who ſuffer'd afterwards, was for their diſobedience to theſe <hi>Acts,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws of the Realm. And the ſeveral deſignes and plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her to take away both her Kingdoms and Life, might not onely oblige her to look to her ſelf, but alſo move her to a greater ſeverity then ſhe was naturally addicted to.</p>
                  <p>Yet hitherto it was not death for <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to be in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if they did nothing elſe. But ſome XIV years after this, the Queen and Parliament ſuppoſed they had Reaſon to <note n="b" place="margin">27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> it <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> onely for being found here; yet they were ſo far from catching any one in a Trap, or without warning, that by the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> they all had time given to tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves freely without any Attachment, with liberty to take Ship at what <hi>Port</hi> they pleas'd, the time allotted them being forty days after the ending of that preſent <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any were ſick, then upon ſecurity they might remain in the Kingdom ſix Months longer, and then to depart. And all this was more favourable then the Proteſtants received from Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us alſo add, that thoſe, whom ſhe had in priſon, ſhe ſent over upon her own charges, and with kinde uſage (ſo far was ſhe from thirſting after bloud, as ſome would have her:) for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof, take one Certificate of twenty Jeſuits and Prieſts, and one Gentleman, ſent from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London, Marſhalſee</hi> and <hi>Kings-bench.</hi>

                  <p>And that the <hi>Bull</hi> it ſelf was thus qualified, or better timed, as we commonly ſay, appears by the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>John Hart</hi> (one of the moſt Learned of their Prieſts then in <hi>England)</hi> in theſe following words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Bull <hi>of</hi> Pius Quintus <hi>(for ſo much as it is againſt the Queen)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice.</note> 
                     <hi>is holden amongst the</hi> Engliſh Catholicks <hi>for a lawful Sentence, and a ſufficient</hi> diſcharge <hi>of her</hi> Subjects Fidelity, <hi>and ſo remaineth in force; but in ſome points touching the Subjects, it is alter'd by the preſent Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For where in that</hi> Bull, <hi>all her Subjects are commanded not to obey her; and ſhe being Excommunicate and Depoſed, all that do obey her, are likewiſe Innodate and</hi> Accurſed; <hi>which point is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Catholicks. For if they obey her, they be in the</hi> Popes Curſe; <hi>and if they diſobey her, they are in the Queens danger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the preſent Pope, to relieve them, hath alter'd that part of the</hi> Bull, <hi>and diſpenſed with them to obey and ſerve her without peril of Excommunication; which Diſpenſation is to endure but till it pleaſe the Pope otherwiſe to determine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> conclude themſelves free and quit of the Papal Curſe for their not Rebelling againſt their Soveraign; though this interpretation or qualification doth no way leſſen their Treachery, ſeeing it was not ſo much their loyalty, as her ſtrength and proſperity that ſecured her in her Throne; their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience being onely a compulſion; the want of a ſufficient force and opportunity being their onely let and hindrance, whilſt their prayers, hearts, and reſolutions were for her Depoſition: ſuch powerful and direful effects have ſuch Papal <hi>Bulls</hi> over ſome mens ſouls and conſciences, to the anulling of Oaths and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the diſtraction of Kingdoms.

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems all their ſpight laid at the Queen; and the better to procure her ruine, there was a little Book compoſed, and call'd <hi>A Treatiſe of Schiſm,</hi> which amongſt other things exhorted the women at Court, to act the ſame againſt the Queen, as <hi>Judith</hi> had done with commendations againſt <hi>Holofernes.</hi> The Author of this pernicious Pamphlet, was one <hi>Gregory Martin,</hi> formerly of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and contemporary with <hi>Campion.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> made him Tutor to his eldeſt Son: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Learning was noted, being a good Linguiſt, and one who had read much; but in his Writings was very paſſionate, and ſo ſometimes inconſiderate: he dyed at <hi>Reimes,</hi> 1582.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>London</hi> now lived one <hi>William Carter,</hi> who had formerly been <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to Dr. <hi>Harpsfeld,</hi> and now the chief Printer for the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> keeping two Preſſes at their devotion: he gets this Book, commended by <hi>Allen,</hi> and prints above a thouſand; for which he is tryed, confeſſeth his printing it, vindicates all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it, is condemn'd and executed, and hath the honour to be Regiſter'd amongſt their <note n="a" place="margin">Concertat.

                  <p>But let us go to a more ſetled contrived Treaſon, and this act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>William Parry</hi> (for ſo he call'd himſelf) a Doctor of Law, and a ſworn ſervant to the Queen: Which take as I gather it out of his own confeſſion, letters, tryal, and examination.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1580, having out-lived his incomes, he became much indebted to one Mr. <hi>Hugh Hare</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who ſuing him for his debt, ſo incenſed <hi>Parry,</hi> that meditating a revenge, one night he went to <hi>Hares</hi> Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> broke open the door, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted him, and left him there for dead (though he afterwards reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd); for which offence he was committed to <hi>New-gate,</hi> indicted of Burglary, tryed, found guilty, and condemn'd to be hang'd; and ſo had ſuffer'd, if the Queen through her mercy had not pardon'd him, and given him his life.</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſee how he requites the Queens grace and favour.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:109877:237"/> In 1582, he gets a Licenſe for travel, and ſo paſſeth beyond Seas: goeth to <hi>Paris,</hi> thence to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where he fell acquainted with <hi>Benedicto Palmio,</hi> a great Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and one received into that Order in the Founders days. <hi>Parry</hi> to him opens his boſome, telling him that he had ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to relieve the oppreſſed <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> which he would reſolutely undertake, if the Pope and other learned Divines would warrant the lawfulneſs of the Action.</p>
                  <p>Old <note n="a" place="margin">—<hi>By him it was reſolved, that he might lay</hi> violent han is upon her Majeſty; <hi>and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolution, and encouraged thereunto.</hi>—Theſe are the words of <hi>W. C.</hi> that is, <hi>Clarke</hi> the Prieſt, in his Reply to a Libel of Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> fol. 60. <hi>b.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Palmio</hi> aſſures him of the lawfulneſs of the Enterpriſe, commends his Zeal, and incourageth him in it. This done, he commends him to <hi>Campeggio</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Venice;</hi> by whoſe means he wrote to the Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, declaring to his Holineſs his deſigne, and deſiring of him a Paſs-port, or Safe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to confer with him about it. The Safe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is ſent him, but not ample enough; and ſo deſires one more full, which is promis'd.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time he falls acquainted with <hi>Chriſtofero de Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King in <hi>Venice,</hi> to whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo open'd ſomewhat of his intent. For the better carrying on of the journey and good will, he gets the ſaid Secretary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the Duke <hi>di Nova Terra,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to <hi>Conde Olivaris,</hi> then <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome;</hi> which is promis'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parry</hi> having ſtaid at <hi>Venice</hi> ſome time, returns to <hi>Lyons,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſent to him a ſufficient Safe-conduct from <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſuring him that he might go and come in the <note n="b" place="margin">—In verbo Pontificis per omnes juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiones Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticas, abſ<expan>

At laſt he opens to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout killing the Queen, which he call'd—<hi>An Act honourable and meritorious to God and the world.</hi>—At ſeveral times they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about it, either of killing of her in <hi>White-hall</hi> Garden, and ſo to eſcape by water, or by St. <hi>James</hi>'s on horſe-back.

<q>
                        <p>It redoubled my former Conceits; every word in it was a warrant to a prepared minde: it taught that Kings may be Excommunicated, Deprived, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently handled: It proveth that all Wars Civil or Forregn undertaken for Religion is honourable.</p>

                  <p>All this while, <hi>Parry</hi> carryed himſelf pretty fair with the Queen, ſeveral times conferring with her, telling her of Cardinal <hi>Como</hi>'s Letter: by which diſcoveries [though he did it onely the better to gain opportunity and credit] he obtained ſo much favour of the Queen, that ſhe not onely thought him a truſty loyal Subject, but intended him a liberal Penſion or Allowance.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt he thus gets eſteem with the Queen, and at the ſame time contrives her death, <hi>Nevil</hi> reſolves to diſcover all; doth ſo, and is examined by <hi>Leyceſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton.</hi> The Queen wonders at the juggle and contrivance, but had it kept ſecret; and the better to finde out the Plot, <hi>Parry</hi> is ſent for by the <note n="a" place="margin">Sir <hi>Fran. Walſingbam.</hi>
                     </note> Secretary to his houſe; there to ſee (according as the Plot was laid) if he would any way confeſs this, who had ſhew'd himſelf ſo ready on his own head, to diſcover the Forraign deſignes againſt her Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary entertains him kindely, telling him, that the Queen had appointed him to deal with him in a matter that highly concerned her Majeſty, knowing him to be one, who bare an extraordinary Devotion to her. Having thus begun, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary told him, that the Queen had been advertiz'd, that there was ſome plot in hand againſt her own perſon; wherewith ſhe thought, he could not but be made acquainted, conſidering the great truſt that ſome of her greateſt Enemies repoſed in him. Of this ſhe deſired to underſtand his knowledge; and whether he himſelf might not ſome time have let ſlip ſome ſuſpitious words, not with any real deſigne againſt her, but to diſcover the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parry</hi> (ſtrongly confiding in <hi>Nevil)</hi> earneſtly denyed it again and again, with ſeveral proteſtations, that he was neither party nor privy to any ſuch motion or enterpriſe. <hi>Walſingham</hi> dealt fairly with him, telling him that there was a Gentleman, and his friend, who would prove the contrary to his face. Yet <hi>Parry</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all; though probably had he confeſt (and theſe were hints e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) and accuſed <hi>Nevil</hi> at this firſt asking, he might have ſaved himſelf: and in this his great cunning was overſeen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parry</hi> thus obſtinate in denyals, is not permitted to go home, but lodged that night at Mr. Secretaries houſe within <hi>London.</hi> This puts him in a peck of troubles, fills his head full of ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and having conſulted with his pillow, the next morning he deſired to ſpeak with the Secretary: which granted, he confeſſeth, that now he had call'd to remembrance, that he once had ſpeech with one <hi>Nevil</hi> concerning a point of Doctrine contain'd in one of Dr. <hi>Allens</hi> books, where it was maintain'd, that it was lawful to take away the life of a Prince, to benefit the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion: but proteſted that he talked nothing of the Queen.</p>
                  <p>That night he was examin'd at <hi>Leyceſter-houſe</hi> before ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but ſtill he denyed all: whereupon <hi>Nevil</hi> was brought before him, who punctually juſtified every circumſtance before his face; yet the other, as formerly, denyed all. However, he is ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where perceiving the exactneſs of the proof againſt him, he freely, and of his own head, confeſs'd all, and ſent his humble Letter to the Queen, which take as followeth.</p>

                  <p>His Father was call'd <hi>Harry ap David,</hi> who kept an Ale-houſe in a little Village, <hi>Northop,</hi> not far from the River <hi>Dee</hi> in <hi>Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> in <hi>North-Wales;</hi> his Mother was a Baſtard, begot by one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Haulkin,</hi> a poor Pariſh cloſe by. Upon the death of his Father, his Elder Brother kept the Ale-houſe, and did ſo after our <hi>Parry</hi> was executed.</p>
                  <p>The Traytor now in hand was one of the younger Sons, and was call'd <hi>William ap Harry,</hi> (according to the cuſtom of <hi>Wales).</hi>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:109877:239"/> When young, he learned a little to write and read, went and ſerved one <hi>John Fiſher</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who pretended to the Law; with him he continued ſome years, ſerving as his Clerk; in which time he learned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and at ſome ſpare hours went to the Grammar-School, where he got ſome skill in <hi>Latin.</hi>

                  <p>About the year 1560, he ran away from his Maſter, got up to <hi>London,</hi> where for ſome time he lived after a ſhirking faſhion, all his ſtudy being to fill his belly and cover his back: at laſt he found a good Maſter, and by degrees, with him and other Maſters, he got ſome money in his purſe. He ſcorns his old name <hi>ap Harry,</hi> but call'd himſelf <hi>Parry,</hi> pretending a kin to all of that name: and from his Mother, Daughter to one <hi>Conway</hi> a Prieſt, he pretends a kindred to the Family of Sir <hi>John Conway,</hi> and ſo allyed to the foreſaid <hi>Edmund Nevil.</hi> Thus having voted himſelf a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he marryeth a rich Widow in <hi>South-Wales;</hi> ſhe dyeth; he lives bravely, waſtes all, and runs into debt: His chiefeſt care is for ſome time to avoid the Serjeants: at laſt he falls in with a rich Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Mrs. <hi>Heywood,</hi> old enough to be his Mother; and her at laſt he marryeth, but lyeth with her Daughter; ruines the Eſtate, and runs far in debt to Mr. <hi>Hugh Hare</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> (aforeſaid) whom in his Chamber he endeavour'd to aſſaſſinate, and is himſelf exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>ap Harry</hi> or <hi>Parry,</hi> ſeveral Couplets were made in thoſe times; ſome of which for diverſion take as followeth, where you may ſee his life and Qualities alſo Epitomized.</p>

                     <p>THe former Treaſon was ſcarce ended, when another begun; which was briefly thus:</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seminary at <hi>Rheimes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there were ſome who pin'd their faith ſo much upon the Popes ſleeve, that they thought his Authority could do any thing; and that the Depoſing <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> V againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> thus wickedly perſwaded, they <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cambd.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, an. 1586.</note> thought it meritorious to take away her life; and to dye in the attempt, would be a glorious Martyrdom.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the reſt, Dr. <hi>William Gifford,</hi> Rector of the Students there, and the finiſher of the Book call'd <hi>Calvino-Turciſmus (William Reinolds,</hi> of whom formerly, was its firſt Author.) He and one <hi>Gilbert Gifford,</hi> and one <hi>Hodgſon</hi> Prieſts, ſo inculcated this treaſonable Doctrine into one <hi>John Savage</hi> (ſaid to be a Baſtard) that he willingly and ſolemnly vowed to kill the Queen.</p>
                     <p>To make the day more ſure, <hi>John Ballard,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> plyeth it about <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to carry on the Cauſe, and to prepare his Diſciples; then goeth into <hi>France</hi> to treat with <hi>Don Bernardin de Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor there, and ſome others, about the invading of <hi>England.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done his errand, he returns to <hi>England;</hi> to forward the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, gets to <hi>London,</hi> where in a Souldiers habit, under the falſe name of Captain <hi>Foſcue,</hi> he agitates his plots.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>London</hi> he opens the buſineſs to one Mr. <hi>Anthony Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Dethick</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> a young Gentleman, rich, well bred, and ſomewhat learned; he had a little before gone to <hi>France,</hi> (without Licenſe) and faln in acquaintance with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſcow</hi> Ambaſſador for the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitive, but a great ſtickler for her.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Babington</hi> is againſt an Invaſion, as fearing it would not take effect as long as the Queen lived. <hi>Ballard</hi> tells him that that need not trouble him, becauſe <hi>Savage</hi> had ſworn to kill her. <hi>Babington</hi> likes the murther, but moves that five other reſolute Gentlemen might be joyned to <hi>Savage.</hi> This agreed on, they carry on the deſigne for the Invaſion. In the mean time <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> giveth notice to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> of the deſigned Murther, and deſires her that—<hi>The Heroical Actors in this buſineſs might be rewarded, or elſe their Posterities, if they periſht in the attempt;</hi> for ſo he worded it. And in this conſpiracie, ſeveral Gentlemen of Quality were aſſiſtants.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> that ſaithful and cunning Secretary, by his Spies diſcovers all, and informs the Queen: and in this, <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Gifford,</hi> Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Plot having run on for ſome time, the Queen thought it dangerous to go too far: ſo <hi>Ballard</hi> is apprehended. <hi>Babington</hi> jealous of a diſcovery, he with ſome of the Confederates hide themſelves in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Wood near the City. Notice being given of their withdrawing, they are proclaimed Traytors; at laſt are found and ſeized on, and the reſt of their Fellow-rebels.

                  <p>THe greateſt Enemies the Queen had, were thoſe whoſe births oblig'd them to obedience; but whether their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, its intereſt, or ſome bad Principles of the Parties, prompted them to ſuch Treaſons, let others judge. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts, were the occaſion of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her ruine; they ſtill thruſting her on to ſo many inconveniences againſt the Queen and Kingdom, that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> was the ſooner perſwaded to conſult her own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by taking away that which ſought her overthrow.</p>
                  <p>As for theſe people, when they ſaw no hope of reſtoring the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion, either by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor her Son; they <note place="margin">

And concerning this, <note n="a" place="margin">Vita <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Laurei</hi> Card. <hi>pag.</hi> 72.</note> 
                     <hi>Ruggerius Tritonius,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Pinaro,</hi> in his life of Cardinal <hi>Vincentius Laurens,</hi> tells us an odd paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> the day before ſhe ſuffer'd death, did under her own hand in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue declare, that her Son <hi>James</hi> ſhould not Inherit <hi>England,</hi> if he remain'd a Proteſtant, but that the right of the Kingdom ſhould be tranſlated to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> And theſe Papers were ſent to the ſaid Cardinal <hi>Laureus,</hi> being by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. made Protector of <hi>Scotland;</hi> who gave them to <hi>Conde Olivares,</hi> then Ambaſſador for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with order to ſend them to his Maſter <hi>Philip:</hi> and this did <hi>Robertus Titius</hi> publiſh [though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Tritonius</hi> the Authors knowledge, and then living] in <hi>Italy</hi> 1599. dedicating it to Cardinal <hi>Montalto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is ſomewhat agreeable to one of the charges laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her at her tryal, that ſhe ſent a Letter to <hi>Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſador, wherein ſhe promis'd to give her right of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> if her Son <hi>James</hi> would not be of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion.</p>

                     <hi>In all her Letters (whereof I received many) ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made mention of Religion, nor labour'd to perſwade me in it; ſo at her laſt words, ſhe commanded her</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But whether ſhe undertook to give away the Title of <hi>England</hi> from her Son, was no great matter, it being againſt all Law, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Reaſon, ſhe having no power to diſpoſe of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>England:</hi> yet the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> when all other endeavours fail'd, to rob King <hi>James</hi> of his Kingdoms and life, had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence about the year 1613. to <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>This <hi>Invaſion</hi> was very much aſſiſted by the <hi>Engliſh Romaniſts</hi> (though not by all, for the Lord <hi>Montague</hi> and ſome others were againſt it.) In <hi>Flanders</hi> lay <hi>Charles Nevil</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Lord <hi>Pagit,</hi> Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> with about ſeven hundred more <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ingaged and ready to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> againſt their own Country.</p>
                  <p>What Company in <hi>England</hi> would have taken their parts, I know not. This is certain, that <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Eldeſt Son of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> was unhappily too much Prieſt rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which procured his impriſonment and a tryal; the cauſe of all which might be laid to <hi>Allen,</hi> who had ſuch a ſway and power over the ſaid Earl, that he could make him do any thing. And the Earl was over-perſwaded to ſet his affection on the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Fleet, rejoycing at its coming, praying heartily for its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and grieved beyond meaſure at its overthrow. But he is not the firſt Nobleman who confided too much in bad counſel, and whoſe Zeal for Religion hurryed him on to inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
                  <p>As for Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> he was born in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> of good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage; was bred up at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>Orial</hi>-Colledge, where he was <hi>Proctor;</hi> was preferr'd to a Canonſhip in <hi>York;</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days quits <hi>England,</hi> becometh Penſioner to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> to carry on whoſe deſignes againſt his Queen and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was very induſtrious; for which ſervice <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. created him a <hi>Cardinal 1587. Auguſt</hi> 7, and he dyed at <hi>Rome 1594. October</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>We have formerly ſhown his ſeditious and King depoſing Principles, of which his foreſaid <hi>Admonition</hi> will give a farther <note place="margin">Quodlibets, <hi>pag</hi> 240, 241, 247.</note> proof: and who were the Promoters of this <hi>Invaſion,</hi> his own words will beſt tell you.</p>
                  <p>—<hi>The King of</hi> Spain <hi>at length, as well by his Holineſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Exhortation, as by his own unſpeakable Zeal and Piety, moved alſo not a little by</hi> My <hi>humble and continual ſuit, together with the afflicted and baniſhed Catholicks of</hi> our Nation, <hi>of all and every Degree, who have been by his ſpecial compaſſion, and Regal Munificencie, principallie ſupported in this our long Exile, hath condeſcended at laſt to take upon him this ſo Holy and Glorious an Act,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, it is moſt certain, that all the world had very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable expectance of that Army, and the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>more then any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, it is plain by the Cardinals Book</hi> [<note n="d" place="margin">They would hint to us, as if <hi>Parſons</hi> were the Compiler of the <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition;</hi> but 'tis certain, that <hi>Allen</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; his name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and <hi>Pitſeus</hi> with the other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Allen</hi> to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> 
                     <hi>if it were his] written as a preparative to that action, that he was made Cardinal of purpoſe for that Exploit, and to have been ſent hither preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the</hi> Spaniards <hi>Conqueſt. But Father</hi> Parſons <hi>ſaith that he labour'd to ſet forward at that time the</hi> Cardinals <hi>preferment (if you will believe him) which maketh it evident</hi> a primo ad ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, <hi>that Father</hi> Parſons <hi>was a dealer in that action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, it is certain, that the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>in</hi> Rome <hi>were great with the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador-Leger there, and had great recourſe unto him when the matter was on foot; doth not this then argue them to be concurrers thereunto?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, it is likewiſe moſt true, that the</hi> Engliſh Jeſuits <hi>in</hi> Rome, <hi>appropriated certain Palaces in</hi> London <hi>to themſelves, to fall unto their lots (when this matter was in handling) to wit,</hi> Burghley-houſe, Bridewel, <hi>and another which I have forgot; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves cock-ſure of their already-devoured Prey.

                     <hi>Colledge at that time will witneſs with me. Now would I demand of you, what reaſons they might have to be their own Carvers, if they had not ſome intereſt in that affair?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, we know, that they were more forward in</hi> Rome <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, then the Cardinal or any other;</hi> Inſomuch, <hi>as at the firſt news of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>coming down into the</hi> Narrow-Seas, <hi>they would have had</hi> Te Deum <hi>ſung in the Colledge-Church for joy of Victory, if the Cardinal had not stayed it.</hi>

                  <p>—<hi>While the</hi> Invaſion <hi>was talk'd of, and in preparation in</hi> Spain, Richard Hesket <hi>was ſet on by the</hi> Jeſuits 1592, <hi>or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, with Father</hi> Parſons <hi>conſent and knowledge, to have ſtir'd up the Earl of</hi> Darby <hi>to Rebellion againſt her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

                  <p>This failing, we have another more dangerous, ſet on by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the higheſt rank; but it ſeems not unworthy the baſeſt actions, though any Religion might'be aſhamed of them.</p>
                  <p>As a Prologue to this, we may underſtand, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> the forward King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having ruined himſelf in the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Expedition, and his great Uncle Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> ſucceeding him in the Kingdom, and dying unmarryed, ſeveral made claim to

Amongſt the reſt, <hi>Don Antonio</hi> Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi> natural Son to <hi>Lewis</hi> brother to <hi>Henry.</hi> To him, being a <hi>Portugaiſe,</hi> many of the people bare an affection; ſo that at laſt the reſt let their Titles ſleep, and the Quarrel onely remain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Philip</hi> II of <hi>Spain</hi> and this <hi>Antonio.</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> having the longeſt Sword, under the conduct of <hi>Alva</hi> wan the Kingdom; ſo that <hi>Antonio</hi> was forced to flee for refuge to our Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who afforded him ſome aſſiſtance and favour; by which means and protection, many <hi>Portugaiſe</hi> ſhipt themſelves for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they were received as friends, with all reſpect and honour.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the reſt was <hi>Roderigo Lopez</hi> a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phyſitian, whom the Queen entertain'd in her own Service, making him Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian to her Houſhold; and <hi>Stephano Ferreira de Gama,</hi> with <hi>Emanuel Loiſie.</hi> Theſe three were inticed by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to undertake the murther of the Queen; for which they were promis'd great rewards: but <hi>Lopez</hi> was to be the main inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>In ſhort, <hi>Lopez, Ferrera</hi> and <hi>Loiſie,</hi> were condemn'd and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at <hi>Tybourn;</hi> where <hi>Lopez</hi> thinking to make ſome Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affirmed that <hi>he loved the Queen as he loved Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> at which the ſpectators could not but ſmile, knowing <hi>Lopez</hi> to be of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time that <hi>Lopez</hi> was dealing withal about the Queens Murther, they, to make more ſure, perſwaded one <hi>Patrick Cullen</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> and a Fencer, to commit the ſame villany a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Royal Perſon.

                  <p>At the ſame time alſo, lived in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> one <hi>Edmund York,</hi> Nephew to the Traytor <hi>Rowland York.</hi> This <hi>Rowland</hi> was a vapouring <hi>Londoner,</hi> the firſt that brought into <hi>England</hi> the uſe of Tucks or Rapiers in ſingle Duels; before which, the manly Back-ſword and Buckler was onely in practice by the greateſt Gallants: This was that ſcandalous <hi>Rowland York</hi> alſo, who baſely betray'd his truſt, and deliver'd <hi>Zutphen</hi> (of which he was Governour) with himſelf, unto the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> to do the ſame with <hi>Deventer;</hi> both of them for the future fighting under the Spaniſh Colours againſt their own Soveraign Queen and Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives beyond Seas, perſwaded this mans Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, <hi>Edmund York,</hi> and one <hi>Richard Williams,</hi> with others, to

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>All theſe deſignes failing, the Fugitives and other Traytors were at their wits end, ſeeing the Queen raign proſperouſly and ſucceſsful; and all their attempts againſt her ruined, always diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and the main inſtruments ſeiz'd on, and deſervedly executed. But at laſt another opportunity offer'd it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1595, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> making his laſt voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> in which he dyed, there was one <hi>Edward Squire,</hi> who was firſt a Pettifogging Clerk, afterwards an under-ſervant in the Queens Stables; and now would try his fortune, as a Souldier in this voyage. It was his chance to go in a little <hi>Pinnace,</hi> which unluckily ſtraying from the reſt, on the Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> was taken by five great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships. By which means, much of <hi>Drakes</hi> deſigne was diſcover'd; and ſo a great part of the exploit prevented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Squire</hi> at laſt was carryed into <hi>Spain</hi> as a priſoner.

                  </p>

                  <p>Preſently after this, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſet ſail for the Iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyage againſt the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> And in this Fleet <hi>Squire</hi> ventured once more as a Souldier, with which he return'd into <hi>England,</hi> and lived for ſome time ſecurely, not thinking that he ſhould ever be diſcover'd.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This way of meanneſs and negligence is ſeldom without a miſchief attending it; and this Family of <hi>Valois</hi> now growing towards its end, wanted the vigour and prudence of her former Kings: now were they <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> like, more apt and fit to accompany the worſt of Women, and hold a Diſtaff, then to manage a Sceptre, or protect a People. Pleaſures were all their ſtudy, and to neglect buſineſs all their care: they were only the picture of Kings, having neither life nor action to Government or Majeſty; leaving affairs to be managed by any that could thruſt themſelves uppermoſt.

                     <hi>Dimanche</hi> gets to <hi>Monçon,</hi> opens all to King <hi>Philip;</hi> in the mean time <hi>de St. Suplice</hi> (one well acquainted with State matters, and after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the <hi>French</hi> Court) diſpatcheth his Secretary <hi>Rouleau</hi> into <hi>France</hi> with the Letters and Intelligence: whereby the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> had means to ſecure her ſelf, and the Plot was ſpoiled by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery.

And though the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> complained of this Conſpiracy, and deſired juſtice of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> yet <hi>Catherine de Medicis</hi> (one not apt to be commended in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) the Queen-mother, turn'd it off by telling her, that it was beſt to forgive thoſe injuries they could not puniſh.

                  <p>At this the <hi>French</hi> King is not a little troubled, looking upon it as a thing of dangerous conſequence, as the common caſes of all other Kings; nor did he like that any third party ſhould have any pretence to ſeize upon thoſe Territories which lay ſo near to and convenient for <hi>Spain,</hi> whom poſſibly he might ſuſpect, though it is ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Queen <hi>Jane</hi> with an aſſurance, that he would protect her and her Dominions againſt any that ſhould aſſault them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, another thing happened which did not a little perplex the King, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (as they call it) being now ended, Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> deſired the Pope to uſe his Intereſt with the <hi>French</hi> King, that it ſhould be receiv'd and approv'd of in his Dominions, that he would

                  <p>For to refuſe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> would render him ſuſpect to the Pope; to receive it would be againſt the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church: to make war againſt the <hi>Huguenots</hi> would not advantage him, as he had found by experience, and he did not much care for Forein aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; to extirpate them quite was not probable to be done, and if he ſhould he muſt deſtroy many of his neareſt Relations; however ſo weaken and impoveriſh the Kingdom, that at laſt it might b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However it be, having been married many years without either Children or Affection to her Husband, ſhe was at laſt divorced from him 1599, as being married againſt her will, and to one that was then an Heretick, and too near a kin to her, beſides the Spiritual Relation, her Father <hi>Henry</hi> II. having been Godfather to her Husband; and all theſe <hi>Nullities</hi> confirm'd, and to the Divorſe rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. though Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. had formerly diſpens'd with them, and approved of the Marriage.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King had ſome <hi>Item</hi> of theſe doings, yet not knowing fully what the aim at was, he ſeem'd to take not much notice, being willing enough to reſt ſecure between theſe and the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> both which were powerful and mortal enemies.</p>

                     </gap>gative voice would fruſtrate all their Councils, they invent a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:109877:262"/> trick to avoid that by deſiring of the King, that he would elect a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Judges, <hi>not ſuſpected by the States,</hi> who together with XII. of the Deputies might hear ſuch Motions, as from time to time ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by every <hi>Order,</hi> and conclude and reſolve upon them: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould be joyntly determined by the Judges and Deputies ſhould have the form and vigour of a Law, without being ſubject to be altered or revoked.</p>
                  <p>But the King ſmelling the deſign offer'd them fair enough, but reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to keep the power in his own hand.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Leaguers</hi> foil'd here go another way to work, and deſire him to extirpate the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> The King is puzled at this requeſt; for ſhould he not comply with it they would declare him to be a Favourer of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whereby he would loſe his Intereſt with the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> beſides conſidering that the <hi>Covenanters</hi> were too ſtrong for him at preſent, he thought it his wiſeſt courſe to comply with them, thereby to get that Authority to himſelf which they endeavour'd to ſettle upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo he was politickly forc'd to take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and declare himſelf the Head of it.</p>
                  <p>Having done this beyond their expectation he reſolves to be as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as themſelves, and ſo he deſires (ſince they ſeem willing for war) to furniſh him with Moneys to carry it on. At this they demur; for though they loved miſchief, yet were unwilling to lay their Moneys at the Kings diſpoſal: by which trick <hi>Henry</hi> ſeem'd left to his own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Covenanters</hi> thus non-plus'd try other means. Firſt, they move that the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> might fully be receiv'd into the Kingdom: but this is rejected by a Majority of <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> and a great part of the Intereſted <hi>Clergy,</hi> as thwarting the Privileges of the <hi>Gallican Church;</hi> for though they love the Religion, yet they care not for the Popes Authority over them. This not fadging they conſult how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Kings power, for which purpoſe they propound that his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> might be reduc'd to the number of XXIV, and that the King ſhould not chuſe them but the Kingdom: but this was alſo rejected, many of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> themſelves thinking it not ſafe too much to exaſperate the King. And thus the deſign but half done the Aſſembly break <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And the King doubting the greatneſs of the <hi>Guiſians</hi> might too much inlarge their Intereſt, a little to clip their wings, by publick <note n="*" place="margin">Spond. <hi>an.</hi> 1576. §. 11.</note> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confirms the Preeminence and Priority to the Princes of the Bloud.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Covenanters</hi> perceiving that the King had ſeen too far into their deſigns, conclude it ſafe for ſome time to forbear all open endeavours, but were very ſedulous in their private Conſultations, by which means they whiſpered the people into diſcontent againſt the King and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſcattering abroad <hi>Libels,</hi> bewitching many <note n="*" place="margin">Jo. de Baſſieres, <hi>tom. 4. p.</hi> 205</note> Nobles and others to their Faction.

                  <p>The King alſo did not want his ways of Devotion, aſſiſting often in their Proceſſions, undergoing Penances, wear Hair ſhirts, had his Beads openly hanging at his girdle, would obſerve Canonical hours; and by

                  <p>Yet neceſſity did force him ſometimes to look about him, and nothing did he dread more then the <hi>Guiſes</hi> and their <hi>League,</hi> whoſe power muſt now be all his ſtudy to diminiſh.

                  <p>And this might the better be perform'd ſeeing he (as alſo his Couſin the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the next Heir after <hi>Navarre</hi>) was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and ſo it would be an eaſie matter to get him declar'd incapable of the Crown as an Heretick.

However things went, it was good at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to act under the feeble Cardinal, as the firſt Prince of the Bloud, as they call'd him. And that the Cardinal look'd upon himſelf as ſo, is confirm'd by this ſtory which they tell us: That a little after the 'fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid death of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> III. asked the Cardinal, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Yet the deſigns of the <hi>Guiſards</hi> were not carried ſo cloſely, but the King had ſome hints of them, which did not a little trouble him.

                  <p>As for the <hi>Declaration</hi> it ſelf, it was rejoyned to by the King in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well and cunningly worded, endeavouring to anſwer all their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, deſiring them to lay down their arms, and admoniſhing all his Subjects not to believe their idle pretences, but to confide in and joyn themſelves to him.</p>
                  <p>But it was not words that were to befriend the <hi>Covenanters:</hi> ſo they draw their Forces together, rendezvouz at <hi>Chalons</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinal <hi>Bourbon</hi> is conducted to them by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with as great demonſtrations of Honour and Joy as could be, the better to inſnare and bewitch the old man, whoſe Name and Intereſt they wero to make ſo much uſe of.

                  <p>Yet they look upon themſelves ſtrong enough to defie any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having muſter'd about 12000 men, expecting daily Recruits of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces hir'd to joyn with them; and thus fortifi'd they ſeize upon ſeveral ſtrong places.

                  <p>The <hi>Guiſards</hi> now thought their Game half done, not doubting but that this <hi>Bull</hi> would take ſo much effect, as for ever to exclude theſe two <hi>Bourbons</hi> and their Poſterity from the <hi>French</hi> Throne, which then would be the more eaſie for them to aſcend. But the <hi>Paris</hi> Parlement (moſt of which ſaw no further into the <hi>League</hi> then the ſpecious outſide) look'd upon it as a thing of dangerous conſequence, that the next heirs to the Crown, ſhould thus ſo ſlightly be Excluded, without advice either of the King or them, to the violation (as they thought) of the Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. And therefore in a full body waited upon the King, deſiring to have the <hi>Bull</hi> torn in pieces, and the Procurers of it to be enquired after, and ſeverely puniſh'd, and affirming to the King that it ought publickly to be burnt. But the King (though he diſliked the manner of the <hi>Bull</hi>) yet at this time, thinking it beſt, neither to offend Pope, Parlement or <hi>Guiſards,</hi> ſaid he would conſider of it; and thus the buſineſs was paſt over, though the <hi>Covenanters</hi> ſpred their Copies abroad with Triumph.</p>
                  <p>But the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> would not brook his Reputation thus to be blaſted, and therefore gallantly (as <hi>Perefiue</hi> ſaith) oppoſed himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papal <hi>Bull,</hi> his Anſwer being ſhort, brisk, in an unuſual ſtile, and not yet (as I know of) clad in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> take as followeth.</p>

                  <p>As for the Pope, being of a fiery diſpoſition, we may ſuppoſe him not a little netled at this Paper; but as by degrees his paſſion cool'd, ſo did he affect <hi>Navarre,</hi> and admire his courage and noble reſolution.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Guiſe</hi> queſtion'd not but that all would go well enough with him; for though once (ſelf-Intereſt being all his deſign) he and his brother the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had made ſome Overtures to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to joyn themſelves with him, with an intent to ruine the <hi>French</hi> Kings Favourites or his Party, that ſo the <hi>Leaguers</hi> might command that Kings perſon and Councils; yet he alſo plotted the overthrow of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> and his Aſſociates, the better to ſecure all Authority to himſelf: to which purpoſe the <hi>French</hi> King was ſo work'd upon, as to <note n="*" place="margin">7 Octob. 1585.</note>

                  <p>Yet the <hi>French</hi> King juſtly diſtruſting the <hi>Guiſards</hi> greatneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, had (the better to keep the Scales even, and to ſecure himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both parties) favour enough both for <hi>Navarre</hi> and a Peace with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and always looking upon <hi>Henry</hi> to be next Heir to the Crown, wiſh'd he would change his Religion, the better to render him more capable to enjoy it. And accordingly began to enter into ſome Treaties with him, which ſo madded the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> that they and the Pulpits ranted very malapertly againſt the King, as one inclining to the Hereticks, and an enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; which falſities and ſlanders were no ſmall trouble to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by them daily lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the goodwill and affection of his <hi>Romaniſh</hi> Subjects: nor was <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> any whit leſs offended at the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from the Pope, the Confiſcation of all the ſaid Kings Hereditary Territories, upon his deprivation by the former <hi>Bull</hi> or Sentence.</p>

And for their better ſecurity they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how to provide themſelves with Arms. The King ſuſpecting ſome miſchief, had by expreſs Order forbidden all Gun-ſmiths, Cutlers, and ſuch like Artificers, to ſell any ſort of Arms, but to thoſe who were well known and allow'd to buy them. Upon this account they pitch upon <hi>Poulain</hi> as the only man in this caſe to ſerve them, who by virtue of his Place and Office might buy up ſtore of Arms without ſuſpicion, and beſides might pretend ſeveral reaſons if any jealouſie grew of him.

                  <p>And now they think it beſt to bring over to their Aſſociation the Grandees and Zealots of other Cities and places: to which purpoſe they diſpatch <hi>Ameline</hi> to ſound the Inclinations of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in the <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> as <hi>Touraine, Anjou,</hi> and other Provinces; who according to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions poſted up and down, to the gaining of many Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.</p>
                  <p>But thus encouraged by their Number, they are willing to dally no <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1586</label> more, but to proceed to action. And ſo a <hi>Caball</hi> being held one day in the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> College near S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> the ſurpriſal of <hi>Boulogne</hi> (a Port-town in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy</hi>) was propoſed, which might be advantageous to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> either for their Fleet in their attempt upon <hi>England,</hi> (now contriving) or to land Forces to aſſiſt the <hi>League,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> might eaſily do from <hi>Flanders.</hi> And this was concluded on, and the Plot laid down how to bring it to paſs. But <hi>Poulain</hi> diſcovers all to the King, by which means the Town was ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The people ſeeing nothing done againſt the King, murmur that the Heads of the <hi>League</hi> are not more forward for action; ſome voting for

Another time the King returning from <hi>Boys de Vincennes,</hi> with no other Company but two Horſemen and four Laquais, they had ſome Plots to ſeize on him then in <hi>St. Antoine</hi>'s Street, (being far from the <hi>Louvre</hi> and ſo his Guards) in an hurry to kill his Coachman and thoſe with him, and then others to cry out, <hi>O Sir, theſe are the</hi> Huguenots <hi>who would ſeize on you.</hi> Which words they ſuppoſed would ſo affright him, that he would quit his Coach, and then they would take him and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him whither they pleas'd, as to <hi>St. Antoine</hi>'s Church, in whoſe Tower they would ſecure him till they were more ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by raiſing up of the people their Aſſociates. But this upon better advice was held too dangerous for them, and ſo neglected: yet <hi>Poulain</hi> informeth the King of it, who reſolved for the future to go better guarded; and would willingly have puniſh'd theſe Conſpirators, but he perceived his Credit too much loſt in <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo his Force far inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now the <hi>Leaguers</hi> proſecute the war againſt the King every where, though he freely offers all pardon that will acknowledge him for their King, and ſends to <hi>Mayenne</hi> again and again to have Peace made, but this the Duke abſolutely denieth, nor will allow ſo much as a Truce, though <hi>Moreſini</hi> the Cardinal Legat interpoſed for the gaining of it; ſo that the King is oblig'd to proclame <hi>Mayenne</hi> and all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents Traitors, and to remove the Parlement and Courts of <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Tours</hi> by Proclamation, himſelf then reſiding there, and many of the Loyal Parlement-men had fled to him from <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <p>But not to trouble my ſelf with their fights and skirmiſhes, the King ſeeing the <hi>Covenanters</hi> reſolved to ruine him, and ſeeing no means for his own preſervation but to throw his thoughts upon the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> (though above all things he abhorr'd an <hi>Huguenot</hi>) who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command a good experienc'd Army, and from whom he need not doubt of aſſiſtanee, <hi>Navarre</hi> having by a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> proteſted againſt the <hi>Covenanting</hi> Rebellion, and proferred his ſervice to fight againſt them in behalf of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſidering oftentimes with my ſelf, and applying my whole underſtanding unto theſe things, which now of late by a juſt judgment of God are come to paſs; I think I may with right uſe the words of the Prophet</hi> Habakkuk—I have wrought a work in your days,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:109877:287" rendition="simple:additions"/> which no man will believe when it is told him—<hi>The</hi> French <hi>King is ſlain by the hands of a Friar; for unto this it may juſtly be compared, although the Prophet ſpake of another thing, namely of the Incarnation of our Lord, which exceedeth and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all other wonders and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whatſoever: As alſo the Apoſtle S.</hi> Paul <hi>referreth the ſame words moſt truly unto the reſurrection of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When the Prophet ſaid</hi> A work, <hi>his mind was not to ſignifie by it ſome common or ordinary thing, but a rare and notable matter, worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, as that of the creation of the world,</hi>—The Heavens are the works of thine hands—<hi>And again,</hi>—He reſted the ſeventh day from all the works which he had made—<hi>When he ſaith,</hi> I have wrought, <hi>with theſe words the Holy Scriptures are wont to expreſs things not come to paſs by caſualty, fortune or accident, but things befallen by the determined providence, will, and ordinance of God, as our Saviour ſaid,</hi>—The works which I do you ſhall do alſo, and yet greater—<hi>and many more ſuch like in the holy Scriptures. And that he ſaith that it is done in times paſt, herein he followeth the uſe and order of the holy Prophets, who for certainty of the event are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of things to come as if they were paſt already. For the</hi> Philoſ. <hi>ſay, that things paſt are of neceſſity, things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of being, &amp; things to come only of poſſibility. For which certainty the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>long before propheſying of the death of Chriſt hath thus ſpoken,</hi>—He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and like a lamb before his ſhearer ſo opened he not his mouth—<hi>And this whereof we ſpeak at this preſent, and which is come to paſs in theſe our days, is a famous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and almoſt incredible thing, nor done or atchiev'd without the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence and diſpoſition of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi> A Friar hath kill'd a King, <hi>not a painted one, or one drawn upon a piece of paper or a wall, but the King of</hi> France, <hi>in the middeſt of his
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:109877:288"/> Army, compaſsed and environ'd round about with his Guard and Souldiers: Which truly is ſuch an act, and done in ſuch a manner, that none wil believe it when it ſhall be told them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hereafter it will be held but for a fable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the King is dead or ſlain, is eaſily believed, but that he is kill'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, is hardly to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited: even as we preſently agree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but if we adde of a Virgin, then according to natural reaſon we cannot aſſent to it: even ſo we eaſily believe that</hi> Chriſt <hi>died, but that he is riſen again from death unto life, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humane underſtanding impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and therefore incredible: that one is awakened again out of ſleep, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, or a ſwound, becauſe it oft hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo according to nature we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believe; but to be riſen again from the dead, it ſeemeth ſo incredible unto fleſh, that S.</hi> Paul <hi>diſputing at</hi> Athens <hi>of this point was diſliked, and accuſed to be a ſetter forth of new Gods; ſo that many (as</hi> S. Luke <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) did mock him, and others ſaid,</hi>—We will hear thee again of this thing—<hi>Of ſuch things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which befall not according to the Laws of Nature, and the ordinary courſe thereof, ſpeaketh the Prophet, that</hi> none ſhall believe it when it ſhall be told them. <hi>But we give credit to it by conſideration of the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of God, and by ſubmitting our underſtanding under the obedience of Faith, and the Service which we owe unto</hi> Chriſt. <hi>By theſe means this that was incredible by Nature becometh credible by Faith. Therefore we that believe not after the fleſh that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is born of a Virgin, yet when it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it, that this was done ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally by operation of the Holy Ghoſt, then truly we agree unto it, and faithfully believe it. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when it is ſaid, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is riſen again from the dead, as we are onely fleſh we believe it not; but when it is affirmed, that this was done by the power of Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:109877:288"/> in him, then without any doubting we believe it.</hi>

                        <hi>that ſuch a mighty King was kill'd by a poor, ſimple, and weak</hi> Friar, <hi>and that in the midſt of his Army, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with his Guard and Souldiers, to our natural reaſon and fleſhly capacity it will ſeem incredible, or altogether improbable; yet conſidering on the other ſide the grievous ſins of the King, and the ſpecial providence of Almighty God herein, and by what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and wonderful means he hath accompliſh'd his moſt juſt judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, then moſt firmly we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi>

                        <hi>Therefore this great and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous work we muſt aſcribe onely to the particular providence of God, not as thoſe who refer all things amiſs unto ſome ordinary cauſes, or unto fortune, or ſuch like accidentary events; but as thoſe who (more nearly obſerving the courſe of the whole matter) eaſily ſee, that here in this befell many things, which could in no wiſe have been brought to paſs without the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al help of God.

                        <hi>In the Holy Scripture ſome are of this kind, and none of them can be referred unto any other thing but unto God the onely Author thereof: yet there are none wherein the Heavenly operation is more ſeen, then in this whereof we ſpeak at preſent. We read in the</hi> Maccabees, <hi>how</hi> Eleazar <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf unto a ſure death to kill the King, who was an enemy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the people of God.

                        <hi>Here we ſee ſome things as to zele, valiantneſs of mind, and the iſſue of the enterpriſe, not unlike unto ours, though in the reſt there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be made. For</hi> Eleazar <hi>was a ſouldier, exercis'd in weapons, train'd up in arms, ſet in battel, emboldened with courage, and inflamed with rage and anger: whereas this</hi> Friar <hi>was not uſed to fighting, and ſo abhorring of bloud by order of his profeſſion, that perhaps he could not abide the cutting of a vein. Again,</hi> Eleazar <hi>knew the kind of his death, as alſo the place of his burial, namely, that he ſhould be entombed under the fall of the beaſt, and ſo buried in his own triumph and victory: but this</hi> Monck <hi>look'd onely for death, and expected nothing but unknown and moſt cruel torments, yea and doubted that he ſhould want a grave to reſt in. But in this are yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things that can ſuffer no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</hi>

                        <hi>The famous hiſtory of the holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Judith <hi>is ſufficiently known, who conſulted how to deliver her city and the people of God (no doubt but by Gods inſpiration) to kill</hi> Holofernes, <hi>Chieftain of the enemies forces, which ſhe alſo accompliſhed.

For this holy woman diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed part of her intention unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the City, and went out with the approbation and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſaid Elders and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and by that means was not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the examination and ſearching, which in time of ſiege is uſed ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a Fly can hardly without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining get by.

By the contraries of which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes we can diſcern the diſtinction and, greatneſs of ſin. As the contrary to power, which is onely attributed unto the Father, is weakneſs; and therefore that which we do amiſs through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:109877:291"/> of nature is ſaid to be committed againſt the Father. The oppoſite to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ignorance, through which if any man ſinneth he is ſaid to ſin againſt the Son; therefore that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit through natural infirmity or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is more eaſily forgiven us. The third attribute, which is the Holy Ghoſts, is love, and hath for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ingratitude, a fault moſt odious; for hence it happens, that men do not acknowledge the love and benefits of God, but do forget, deſpiſe, and hate them; whence it followeth that they become altogether obſtinate and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. And this way ſin is committed againſt God with greater danger and peril, then if it were done through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or weakneſs of the fleſh, and therefore it is termed a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And becauſe ſuch ſins are ſeldom or difficultly pardoned, and that not without a great abundance of grace, and ſo in ſome fort are ſaid to be unpardonable, whereas indeed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſimply unpardonable only through unrepentance. For whatſoever is done amiſs in this life, although it be againſt the Holy Ghoſt, yet by repentance may be forgiven before death: but they that perſevere therein till death are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all grace and mercy. And therefore for ſuch ſins and ſinners, it is that the Apoſtle hath forbidden to pray after their deceaſe.</hi>

                     <hi>Cardinal</hi> doth not poſſitively deny there was any ſuch Speech, and if he had known there had been no ſuch thing, he would at this time (being pleaded againſt him by King <hi>James</hi>) have boldly denied it, and he could not be ignorant, being then famous and <hi>Praelector of Controverſies</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> intimate with the Pope and Cardinals, and ſo not willing to be catch'd in a lie, he endeavours to ſhuffle it off as well as he can.</p>
                  <p>One time he ſaith, it was onely publiſhed by the enemies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.

                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proceeds, intimating no ſuch Speech could be divulged ſeeing none took notes of it as it was ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>To this may be anſwer'd, that it is true that the Cardinal, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it was to have noted the Popes Oration, not dreaming of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, neglected the providing of Pen or Ink; but yet how it was taken this following ſtory will tell.</p>

                  <p>The Oration and Conſiſtory being ended, and the Pope departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Chamber, certain Cardinals with a greedy deſire flocked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Cardinal <hi>Allan</hi> (an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> created 1587) there in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, intreating him that he would call to remembrance, and write down what he had heard there ſpoken. <hi>Allan</hi> won by their importunity (they being his friends) promiſed to do his beſt.

And ſome will tell us of ſome prophetick obſervations in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half <note place="margin">Andre du Cheſne <hi>les Antiquitez de</hi> France, <hi>p.</hi> 109, 632.</note> of the Family of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>

                  <p>As how <hi>Louis de Bourbon,</hi> the third Duke of that Line, (who died 1410) building his houſe call'd <hi>Hoſtel de Bourbon</hi> near to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> cauſed to be written over the Portal in Capital Letters this word <hi>ESPERANCE,</hi> viz. <hi>Hope;</hi> as if he expected ſome of his Race would aſcend the Throne, and joyn the two Houſes. And 'tis further obſerved, that in the fine Chapel of <hi>Bourbon l'Archambaut de Lys,</hi> that the ſame day that the former <hi>Henry</hi> was ſtabb'd, a clap of thunder whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away a Bar, which croſs'd and touch'd the ſaid window, without any damage or harm to the Glaſs or Painting.</p>
                  <p>But leaving theſe gueſſes as nothing to our purpoſe, we ſhall find our <hi>Henry</hi> IV. (no more call'd <hi>Navarre,</hi> but King) in great perplexities how to behave himſelf at this miſhap. For though the <hi>Huguenots</hi> freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him as King of <hi>France,</hi> yet he was not to truſt too much to them, leſt he ſhould offend the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> ſome of whom ſhewed alſo a willingneſs to allow him for their King without any conditions, but the greater part abſolutely denied it, unleſs he would aſſure them to maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and give hopes of his own Converſion; whileſt others of them abſolutely renounced him, and preſently ran over to the <hi>Leaguers:</hi> By which jealouſies and Factions this conquering great Army was on a ſudden ſo dwindled away, that the King was neceſſitated to raiſe the ſiege, and retire for his own ſecurity.</p>

And the truth is, the moſt vigorous and earneſt promoters of the <hi>League</hi> were the Prieſts and Women, the firſt acting as well by the Sword as their Seditious Preachments, the later encouraging and gaining by their boldneſs and inſinuations; nay, ſo zealous were they in this Cauſ, that from the higheſt to the loweſt they were not aſham'd to act any thing to gain Proſelytes; ſo that the King ſuppos'd, that what his Armies wan in the Field they loſt by theſe Love-tricks, ſeveral of his Officers being now and then wheedled over to the <hi>League,</hi> when they came under the lieur of ſuch attractive baits at <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <p>Yet the <hi>Leaguers</hi> were quite creſt-fallen after the King had totally routed <hi>Mayenne</hi> and his great Army at the battel of <note n="*" place="margin">14 <hi>March,</hi> 2590.</note>

                        <p>Whereupon our minds and heads are altogether ſo occupied, that we are fully determined ere long to put in print to the view of the world certain Articles concerning theſe points, and ſend them firſt unto your Holineſs, and afterwards diſperſe them in all places of the world, partly to a perpetual reproach and upbraiding of the Inhabitants of this Realm, if (ſo often times admoniſhed) with baſeneſs and cowardlineſs of heart, they ſhould conſent to ſubmit themſelves under the yoke and bondage of an Heretick; partly to ſtir and raiſe up every mans affection, to ſend with all expedition aid and relief unto our diſtreſſed Affairs. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leave behind us for our Succeſſours ſure witneſſes and tokens of our care and <hi>loyalty to our Country,</hi> and ſo to disburthen our Conſciences, and purge and diſcharge our ſelves before God, his Angels, and the World, not to have forgotten our duties in time of perſecution, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to have confeſt the name of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>It therefore concerneth your Wiſdom (moſt Holy Father) to foreſee (ſeeing we are now in theſe dangerous days, whereout we cannot eſcape without great miracle) that this evil turn not to the deſtruction of your Holineſs, and the utter overthrow of the Apoſtolick See; and that the judgment of God (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, and the continual and known threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſeem to confirm) begin not at his houſe, and that that Serpent (which hath till now been nouriſhed, defended, and by thoſe unto whom it did not become moſt courteouſly uſed) ſpit and caſt not his

                        <p>And while there is any hope remaining, that with all ſpeed your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs linger not to draw the two-edged ſword, although too late we fear (but who knoweth if God will be appeaſed and forgive us our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?) upon this <hi>noiſom beaſt,</hi> and diſplay all force and power againſt it.

                        <p>Wherein we proteſt before the ſame Almighty and High God, and his Angels, that herein we have performed our charge and duty; and therefore if here be written any thing ſomewhat <hi>bitterly,</hi> we pray your Holineſs to take it in good part, as coming from a <hi>burning zeal,</hi> towards the Church now periclitating and ready to fall; and therefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it behoveth that all our thoughts be fixed in the defence of <hi>Sion,</hi> whoſe duties we judge it to be to leave nothing undon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might by all means poſſibly both things above and beneath, and all that is in Heaven and Earth move and provoke for to pity her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed eſtate, becauſe it is more then full time ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>This Treaty was preſently made known, thinking to do <hi>Mayenne</hi> a diſpleaſure, and ſo it did, both the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Leaguers</hi> being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him, in offering to treat without their conſent or knowledge, and ſo made jealous as if intended to leave them in the lurch.

Upon all theſe and other ſuch like conſiderations the King is perplext beyond meaſure, now clearly perceiving that all of them were gone to that height of Conditional Subjection, as never to receive him for King unleſs he would be of their Religion, nor was his force ſufficient to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

                  <p>In the <hi>States</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carried high for the <hi>Infanta,</hi> many ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to it for intereſt-ſake; but when they named <hi>Erneſt</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Emperors Brother, for her husband, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as not fitting to give the Kingdom to a ſtranger. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſmelling the deſign, offered to admit of a <hi>French</hi> Prince to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Philips</hi> daughter, which took pretty well, <hi>Guiſe, Nemours, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and <hi>Mayenne</hi> his ſons, each of them hoping to be the Man and King. Nay, ſome who ſeem'd to be the Kings Friends and Allies, as Cardinal <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, began to hearken to this Propoſal, every one fancying to make the Crown his, upon which conceits they were not ſo earneſt in the Kings Cauſe and Intereſt as they ſeem'd to be.</p>
                  <p>The King perceiving that the Authority of the Pope was one of his greateſt Enemies or Pretences, had a great minde to have him pacified, to which purpoſe he formerly had the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando de Medici</hi> Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to uſe their intereſts in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half at <hi>Rome;</hi> and to further it had alſo been ſent Cardinal <hi>Pietros de Gondy,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Piſani,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> with the King upon the ſame Errand. But the Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to enter into the Eccleſiaſtical Territories, as being Favourers of Hereticks, well-Wiſhers to <hi>Navarre,</hi> with whom they had preſumed to ſpeak and treat, to which ſome Reaſons and Excuſes being returned, the Pope at laſt permits them to enter <hi>Rome.</hi> And at laſt the King himſelf gave fair Signes and Proffers to the Conference at <hi>Surenne,</hi> not only of his being willing to be inſtructed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, but as it were ready to be of it.</p>
                  <p>This amazeth the <hi>Covenanters</hi> to the purpoſe, the <hi>Legat</hi> proteſteth againſt the Conference as dangerous, that they could neither treat with, nor admit of a peace with <hi>Navarre,</hi> being a declared Heretick, and that if they did either, he for his part would quit the Kingdom; and this he publiſh'd in Print that every one might take notice of it. Nor were the <hi>Spaniard</hi> leſs concerned, who (fearing the Kings Converſion, would make haſte and be excepted of, thinking to ſpoil it) Nominates the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> for Husband to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſhewing it was ſo in his Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>At this <hi>Mayenne</hi> is ſtung to the heart, nor could he ſo much diſſemble but his thoughts were perceived; however he thanks them for their kindneſs to his Nephew, and deſires time till things were better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But this Nomination being known, the Embaſſadors, Nobles, Citizens, and every one flock to pay their ſervice to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and give him joy, his Palace is fill'd, himſelf cried up, and now they vapour of a new Kingling, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>The Duke alſo (thus perplext to ſee himſelf as it were laid aſide) puts many into young <hi>Guiſe</hi> his head, demands ſtrange and exorbitant Conditions of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for performance; yet thinking theſe not ſure enough, deſigneth a Treaty with Cardinal <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and leſt this alſo ſhould fail, cunningly dealeth with the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to make a <hi>Decree,</hi> that the Crown ſhould not be transfer'd to ſtrangers, and the

Having conſider'd with himſelf what an abominable life he had led, reſolved to do ſome noble and meritorious action for the benefit of Religion, thereby to waſh and wipe out the ſtains of his own crimes and offences. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often heard it preach'd from the Pulpit, diſcourſed of and diſputed in the Schools (where he converſed) that it was not onely lawful but glorious to kill Heretical Kings, and particularly <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> Thus nurs'd up, he concluded nothing could be more meritorious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and acceptable to God and Man, then the taking out of the world <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom he was taught to believe to be truly no King, but a

                  <p>They null'd and made void all their Oaths of Allegiance, as ours did.</p>
                  <p>They declared that Allegiance was but Conditional, <hi>viz.</hi> to a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi> as ours did to a Covenanter.</p>
                  <p>They made many Oaths in behalf of Conditional Subjection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, as out late Zealots did.</p>
                  <p>They had their Doctors or Divines of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> to countenance and vindicate their wicked Actions, and to declare for good whatever they would have them; As ours had their Club of <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines,</hi> to prove new Governments, and King-oppoſing to be by <hi>Divine Right</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They made Baniſhment and other Penalties for thoſe who would not take and ſubſcribe their Oaths, as our Rebels did for their <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Engagements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had their particular Proceſſions, and ſuch like Set-pieces of Devotion, to crave Divine Aid and Aſſiſtance, as ours had their <hi>monthly Faſts</hi> to deſire God to bleſs their ſins and Rebellions, as alſo their <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> like the old <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who uſed to thank God, if by Theft or Robbery they had got a good booty.</p>
                  <p>They had their Oaths of Abjuration as well as ours had.</p>

                  <p>Some of them would have their Chieftain <hi>Mayenne</hi> to be King, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>England</hi> would have had <hi>Oliver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As their <hi>Mayenne</hi> would not take upon him (when offered to him) the Title of King, becauſe his Intereſt was not then ſufficient to vindicate it, and ſo would only be Lieutenant of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> thus <hi>Oliver</hi> upon the ſame account refuſed the Kingſhip, but would be <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They commended <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Mayenne</hi> as the only Prop of their Church, as ours by their Addreſſes did ſacrilegiouſly magnifie <hi>Oliver,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had their <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>ſecluded</hi> Members as well as we, but in this the <hi>French</hi> were worſt of the two, they turning out honeſt men, whilſt ours excluded only Conditional ſubjects, <hi>i. e.</hi> Traitors, ſo one Knave turn'd out another.</p>
                  <p>They ſent to the Popiſh Princes large Complaints againſt their King, as ours with their Schiſmatical <hi>Aſſembly</hi> againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>They would take away the Kings <hi>Negative Vote,</hi> and make the <hi>States</hi> ſuperiour to him, ſo would our <hi>Roundheads</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>They ſent a Letter to deſire Protection and Aſſiſtance from <hi>Spain,</hi> (an enemie to their King and Countrey) as the <hi>Scotch Covenanters</hi> did from the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> againſt their King <hi>Charles I.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Letter, ſubſcribed by their Chieftains.</p>
                  <p>They in Triumph conducted <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his friends into <hi>Paris,</hi> as our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did the <hi>five Members,</hi> &amp;c. to the affront of King and Government.</p>
                  <p>They by their Tumults forced their King to flee from his chief City and Court <hi>Paris,</hi> as our <hi>Puritans</hi> did King <hi>Charles I.</hi> from <hi>London</hi> for his own ſafety.</p>
                  <p>When their King offered them and their General <hi>Mayenne</hi> Pardon, Favour, and deſired a Peaee, they reject both it and him, as ours did with King <hi>Charles,</hi> when he offered the ſame to them and their General <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They cenſure all who ſided with the King, and ſat at <hi>Tours</hi> or <hi>Chaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> as ours did thoſe who ſat at <hi>Oxford</hi> as a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>They broke the Kings <hi>Great Seals,</hi> making new ones, as ours alſo did.</p>

                  <p>They had their Women of all Qualities to promote their Cauſe by their Love-tricks and Contributions, as the Puritans in <hi>England</hi> had their <hi>Wives, holy Siſters,</hi> and zealous Ladies, hurried along with as much Chaſtity and Religion, as Honeſty, Moderation, or Loyalty.</p>

                  <p>They renounced all obedience to <hi>Henry III.</hi> and his Queen, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered he ſhould not be prayed for; as our wicked <hi>Presbyterian Long-Parliament</hi> declared the Queen a Traitor, renounced the King by their abominable Votes, and Declaration of <hi>Non-Addreſs,</hi> and it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards death to pray for him.</p>
                  <p>They often attempted the death of <hi>Henry IV.</hi> contrived and procured the Murther of <hi>Henry III.</hi> as ours deſigned King <hi>Charles</hi>'s death in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and at laſt murthered him on the Scaffold.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Henry III.</hi> was kill'd, ſome of them would not acknowledge his Succeſſor <hi>Henry IV.</hi> but would have a Government or Ruler of their own making; others would admit him if he would turn <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.</hi> As when King <hi>Charles I.</hi> was martyred, ſome would not at all have his heir <hi>K.

                  <p>They often endeavour'd to ſeize on their King, then to kill him or depoſe him by clapping him up in a Monaſtery, but fail'd in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; whileſt ours had the luck of it to conquer, and ſo to act with our King as they pleaſed. Though 'tis plain the <hi>French</hi> had as bad intents, though not the like ſucceſs and opportunities, it may be their Kings were not ſo much betray'd as ours.</p>
                  <p>Yet herein lay the difference, whereby the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were moſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; their Troubles and Seditions being countenanced, acted and headed by the moſt learned and knowing of their Clergy, as <hi>Popes, Cardinals,</hi> and their <hi>Prelats;</hi> whilſt our Rebellion and Schiſm was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, and noiſed up by an ignorant pack of <hi>Lecturers,</hi> fellows of no Religion, having not Learning to apprehend any.</p>

                     <pb n="620" facs="tcp:109877:314"/> for preſenting an Abbey to Cardinal <hi>Pio,</hi> ſo that his Highneſs for Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, was forced to give it to the Popes Nephew.</p>
                  <p>Thus his deſign went on to ruin the Temporal Authority. In the mean time, the Commonwealth of <hi>Luca,</hi> conſidering that many of their Citizens changed their Religion, and retired into the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Countries, publiſh'd an <hi>Edict</hi> prohibiting any of their Subjects to have any Commerce with ſuch people. The Pope lik'd the Law, but would not have it made by Lay-men, ſo commanded them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Pope takes Pet at theſe honeſt Orders, affirming they were againſt the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Liberty,</hi> ſo Commands the Commonwealth to revoke theſe <hi>Edicts,</hi> or elſe he would thunder againſt them his Cenſures of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. By which Terror, both the States of <hi>Luca</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> were forced to obey his Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Popes deſign went fairly on, nor did he doubt any place in <hi>Italy,</hi> unleſs the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> which uſed to act upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples moſt honourable and beneficial to themſelves, without any reſpect to the Intereſt or Bribery of other Potentates. The Pope had now reſident at <hi>Venice,</hi> as his <hi>Nuncio, Horatio Matthei</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gierace,</hi> a great Stickler and Boaſter of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Liberty,</hi> as they call'd it; and in his way ſo zealous, that he thought all Chriſtian Actions and Graces were of no validity, unleſs this alſo were promoted beyond all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                  <p>The Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> conſidering the miſtake of Charity and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [the Zealots thinking nothing ſo holy as the multiplying of Churches, where no * need is,] made a Decree, (1603.) that, <hi>None</hi>

                  <p>The Senat alſo (agreeable to the old Statutes of their Republick <hi>anno</hi> 1333 and 1536.) made a <hi>Decree</hi> like our <hi>Engliſh Mort-maine,</hi> That <hi>None ſhould ſell, give or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any more lands to the Clergy without the Senats Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi>

                  <p>A little after the making of theſe Laws, the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles between them and the Pope began. The Occaſion taken thus.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Scipio Sarraceno,</hi> a Canon of a Church of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> had with great Contempt deſaced the ſeal of the Magiſtrate, which was put to, for the cuſtody of the Biſhops Court of Chancery, at the requeſt of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the <hi>See</hi> being vacant. And farther, had earneſtly endeavoured to ſeduce a young Gentlewoman his Cozin, uſing many ſolicitations to her,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:109877:314"/> both in publick and in the Church; but not gaining his deſires, according to a common kind of Revenge and Affront in <hi>Italy,</hi> he filthily bewray'd her door, portal, and the ring thereof, and did her ſome other wrongs. The young Gentlewoman upon advice, puts in her Complaint to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at <hi>Venice,</hi> whereupon the Canon is Cited and Impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>Of this the Pope is informed, who cryeth out that the Liberties of the Church are violated, that he will not permit Eccleſiaſticks in any Caſe to be judged by Lay-men, that Satisfaction is to be given and the Canon releas'd. The <hi>Venetians</hi> return, That their Republick is free, that they have the ſame autority with other Princes, ſo can take cogniſance of the Crimes of their own Subjects within their own Dominions and puniſh them according to the falt.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this is convaſing, happens another accident, The Count <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delino Valdemarino</hi> Abbot of <hi>Nerveſe,</hi> being guilty of many Exorbitant Crimes, as</p>

                  <p>For theſe and ſuch other crimes, the <hi>Abbot</hi> is by Order of the <hi>Senate</hi> Impriſon'd. At this the Pope alſo takes offence, denying the Temporal Authority over Prieſts, that the Church can only take cogniſance of them, be their falts never ſo great or notorious. And in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humour layeth a Quarrel againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> unleſs they will ſatisfie him in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>That they null the Decree, concerning the building of any more Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>That they alſo null and void the other Decree, touching the giving of lands to Eccleſiaſticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. <hi>That the Abbot and the Canon be releas'd, and delivered up to his Nuntio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A great deal of do, there was on both ſides, but the Pope perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily informed the <hi>Senate,</hi> that at firſt, he would ſend an Exhortory <hi>Breve</hi> to them, and if he were not obey'd by ſuch a time, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther, <hi>having power over all, could deprive Kings, and to this end had Legions of Angels for his aid and aſſiſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly he ſent two <hi>Breves:</hi> The <hi>Nuntio</hi> delivers them to the <hi>Senate,</hi> but they were not open'd, becauſe <hi>Marini Grimani,</hi> the Duke was then on his Death-bed, and dyed the next morning. The Pope upon notice of this, orders his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to proteſt unto the State againſt any new Election, as in it ſelf to be void, by being made by men excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Thinking by this Trick to bring a Confuſion amongſt them. The

                     <hi>Nuntio,</hi> to execute this Command, with great importunity deſired Audience of the <hi>State,</hi> but it was not granted him, it being not their Cuſtom to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any, during the Vacancy, unleſs their buſineſs be only of Condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Grimani</hi> being buryed [for till the former Duke be under <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1606</label> ground, they cannot go to the choice of another] they fell to their <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotation</hi> or Lots, and the Election fell upon <hi>Leonardo Donato.</hi> Having thus got another <hi>Doge</hi> or Duke, they open the <hi>Breves,</hi> which they found to be one and the ſame in Tenor, which the Pope ſaid was through the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s miſtake, in delivering two of the ſame, inſtead of two different ones.</p>
                  <p>The Pope ranted fairly againſt their <hi>Decrees</hi> about Churches and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, affirming that—<hi>Theſe Ordinances tended to the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls, to publick ſcandal, were of themſelves void and of no value, and no man obliged to obſerve them. That they who had made theſe Statutes or any like, or who did further them, had incur'd Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures; had deprived themſelves of ſuch lands as they held of the Church; and their Eſtates and demains were ſubject to other penalties: that they could not be abſolved unleſs they revoked the Decrees. So he admoniſh'd the</hi> Republick <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Danger, whereinto they had caſt their ſouls, to ſeek a Remedy, and commanded them under pain of Excommunication to null the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. That otherwiſe he would proceed farther, conſidering the account he was to give to God at the Day of judgment; and that he could not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he ſaw the Eccleſiaſtical Authority ſo abuſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> anſwer'd all, warily and wiſely; but yeilded not a jot of their Authority. At which the Pope was incenſed, ſaying they <hi>were Tyrants and different from their Anceſtors;</hi> being reſolved, <hi>though he ſhould loſe his skin yet he would maintain the cauſe of God of his own Reputation.</hi> And ſo orders his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to give the other <hi>Breve,</hi> which through miſtake (as he ſaid) he had not formerly preſented. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> obeys, and the <hi>Senate</hi> opening it, found it to concern the Impriſonment of the <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> which the <hi>Breve</hi> ſaid was <hi>Contrary to the Holy Canons, and to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Liberty, which were grounded on divine Ordinance; ſo commanded under pain of Excommunication, that the Canon and Abbot ſhould ſpeedily be delivered to his</hi> Nuntio <hi>and that if in the mean time the ſecular power had proceeded to any acts, or ſentence of Condemnation or Execution, he did null them, and declare them void: Threatning if he were not ſpeedily obey'd, he would proceed farther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Senate vindicated themſelves by an Anſwer, but nothing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Pope, who told their Ambaſſador that the <hi>Exemption of Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> was <hi>de jure divino,</hi> and that <hi>his cauſe was the cauſe of God; that he would not depart any thing from his Reſolution, and he would be obeyed.</hi> And thus reſolved, calls a <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> where were preſent XLI. Cardinals, who agree with the Pope; ſo a <hi>Breve</hi> of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication or Interdict is drawn up, printed and publiſh'd againſt the Duke, Senate, and the Republick.</p>
                  <p>It contain'd,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the</hi> Venetians <hi>had lately made ſome Decrees, contrary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apoſtolical See, the Eccleſiaſtical Liberty, General Councels, Sacred Canons, and the Conſtitutions of the Pope.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> perceiving the Popes malice and indiſcretion by this Paper <hi>Interdiction,</hi> firſt order'd that every one ſhould have recourſe to his prayers, then to teſtifie their ſenſibleneſs of the wrong done them, recall'd home <hi>Duodo</hi> their extraordinary Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome;</hi> but, to prevent an abſolute Rupture, they let <hi>Nani</hi> their Ordinary Ambaſſador ſtay. Then was command given to all Eccleſiaſtical Parſonis not to publiſh or permit to be publiſh'd or affix'd in any place, any <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Breves:</hi> And by Proclamation it was commanded, that whoever had any Copy of the former <hi>Breve</hi> or <hi>Interdiction</hi> againſt the Serene Republick ſhould bring them unto the Magiſtrates: all which were obey'd, and ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Copies brought in, that it was a wonder that ſo many had been printed and carefully or ſeditiouſly ſpread abroad.</p>

                  <p>And ſo great Authority had the Papal <hi>Interdict</hi> with ſome of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> intended to obey it, though contrary to the Command of their Prince and Senate.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the Senate demanding their Anſwer, they return'd that <hi>they might continue the Divine Offices, their Sermons and Confeſſions according to their Cuſtom.</hi> For upon notice of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> they had ſent <hi>Achilles Gail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardi</hi> (a <hi>Paduan</hi> noted <hi>Jeſuit</hi> &amp; the Author of ſome <hi>meditations</hi>) to repreſent unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> what good Services they might do his cauſe, if he would permit them to ſtay in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions.

But the Pope underſtanding the badneſs of Example, if ſuch a famous Order ſubmitted not to his <hi>Breve,</hi> ſent them an Expreſs to depart. Now the Term of the XXIV. days appointed in the <hi>Monitorie</hi> approaching, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were required to give their final Reſolution, who return'd an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs refuſal to ſay <hi>Maſſe:</hi> which being retorted upon them as a baſe <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> they replyed, it was not contrary to their former promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for the Excellency of it, is not comprehended under the words of <hi>Divine Offices.</hi> The Senate ſeeing themſelves thus abuſed by theſe people, commanded the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſpeedily to depart their Dominions; Upon this, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſuddenly collected a great ſumm of money from their Devoted ones, ſo packing up as faſt as they could; in the Evening they departed the City, each one carrying the <hi>Hoſt</hi> at his neck, intimating that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> departed with them; as they took Bark, the people cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt them, <hi>Go with a vengeance, and come no more hither.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure, they had hid their richeſt Ornaments, burn'd great quantity of writings, and there was found in their Colledges a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cruſes to melt metals, which left ſome blot upon them, though <hi>Poſſevino</hi> indeavour'd to vindicate them from any deſign of gold or ſilver.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Senate having thus wiſely given an hint of their Reſolutions, by their dealing with the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> Put forth an Order, that <hi>all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks who would not continue Divine Services, ſhould retire out of their Dominions.</hi> Upon this, the <hi>Capuchins</hi> with whom the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> had tamper'd very much, reſolved alſo to depart, and intended to go (according to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Inſtructions to them) out in <hi>Proceſſion</hi> with the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> thereby to ſtir up the people to Sedition; who have moſt affection to this Order, pretending to great poverty &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: But this ſolemnity was hindred by Authority: So in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning celebrating one <hi>Maſie,</hi> eating up all the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they concluded the Office, without giving <hi>Benediction</hi> to the people, and then depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo did the <hi>Theatins</hi> and the reformed <hi>Franciſcans.</hi> But it was obſerved that the <hi>Capuchins</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo</hi>
                     <pb n="630" facs="tcp:109877:319"/> (where were no <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to ſeduce them) did not depart, but remain'd Obedient to their Governours celebrating <hi>Divine Service,</hi> for which honeſty and loyalty, they were bitterly perſecuted by their ſuperiors at <hi>Rome,</hi> with Excommunications and other Cenſures.</p>
                  <p>Now began a fierce diſpute amongſt them, <hi>Whether all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred by the Prieſts that ſtaid contrary to the</hi> Interdict, <hi>were nullities or no? Whether it was lawful to adore the Euchariſt ſhewn by ſuch Priests?</hi> And <hi>Whether it was a Mortal or Venial Sin, to hear Maſſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by ſuch Prieſts?</hi> Of theſe every one judged according to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as is uſual in ſuch caſes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> by their Inſtruments, did what they could to ſtir up Sedition in the State, and ſo did other Eccleſiaſticks ingaged on the Papal faction: but the Senate, by their prudence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all, and being perfectly united amongſt themſelves, kept the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a true Obedience to them.</p>
                  <p>The Quarrel growing dayly greater and greater, each party addreſſed themſelves to the reſpective Princes in Chriſtendom, to render their cauſe chear and legal; the Princes deſiring and perſwading a Reconciliation, every one of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> offering to be Mediators.</p>
                  <p>The Pope troubled that the <hi>Venetians</hi> would not ſtoop to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, invented another Plot, whereby he thought to make ſome Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions amongſt them. And this it was. He publiſh'd a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> whither he invited all Chriſtians, granting Indulgences, Abſolutions, and Pardons to all, but thoſe of <hi>Interdicted</hi> places. By this Strategem, he fancyed, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> people. ſeeing themſelves thus deprived, of ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and graces, would diſobey the Senate and run into Sedition. And the better to carry this on, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> gave notice, that though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were excluded in the general, yet they had power from his Holineſs, to grant it to ſuch of them as would obſerve the <hi>Conditions</hi> by them propounded, amongſt which were theſe, <hi>Not to go to Maſſe, Nor to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the reaſons and actions of the Senate.</hi> But all theſe plots did the Pope little good. Nor did their orher lyes againſt the Republick, as if it had renounced the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and become <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> avail them any thing.</p>
                  <p>The Pope ſeeing the bad event of all theſe deſigns, ſends to <hi>Philip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to deſire his Aſſiſtance: The King returns an Anſwer, that <hi>he had deſired an Accommodation, but ſeeing the Honour of his</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>concerned, he would aſſiſt him with his forces, which he had alſo ſignifyed to his Miniſters in</hi> Italy. This Letter was received at <hi>Rome</hi> with the greateſt joy and Triumph Imaginable; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their meritorious actions to the Pope. But others gave different Cenſures of the Letter; ſome thinking it procured by the Authority of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> the then great Favourite of <hi>Spain</hi> who ruled King and all things elſe: But others believed, that the deſign of it was not, as it appear'd, really for war; but thereby to render the <hi>Venetians</hi> more ſubmiſs and tractable for a peace.</p>
                  <p>However the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> the Catholick Kings Governour at <hi>Milan</hi> ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tting to be behind: ſo that now both parties ſeem'd running into a War: both Pope and Duke drumming up men, and making all things ready for Offence and Defence.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe preparations went on, the better to diſorder and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Santa Croce,</hi> having received the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:109877:319" rendition="simple:additions"/> Benediction by his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> departed from <hi>Naples</hi> with XXVI. <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Gallies, and at <hi>Meſſina</hi> received the addition of XIV. more, thence ſecretly ſailing along, entred the <hi>Golf</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> fell upon <hi>Durazzo</hi> a City in <hi>Albania</hi> belonging to the <hi>Turks,</hi> which he ſack'd and returned with Plunder and Priſoners. Hoping by this means, to incenſe the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſo to make him fall out with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and invade their Territories in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> But the Turk, in this more Religious than the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> underſtanding the baſe deſign, ſcorn'd to break with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> in this juncture, but offer'd the Republick his Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>This wicked deſign thus failing, the Partiſans of the Pope went ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to trouble the Republick, maintaining in Print, that <hi>The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages made within the Interdicted Territories were invalid, the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Conjunction Adultery, and the Children all Bastards.</hi> This was a cunning plot to amuſe the zealous and ſimple; but the wiſdom of the Senate, and the reaſons of their writers, daſh'd this to pieces alſo: Though the <hi>Roman</hi> Inquiſition was very furious in their judgments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding under pain of Excommunication any of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Papers or Reaſons, to be intertain'd or read, as Schiſmatical and Heretical; and Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was very active with his Pen againſt the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> laboured what they could for a Reconciliation, and the Emperour and Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> were not ſlack in affording their aſſiſtance to a peace. But the means ſeem'd difficult; for the Pope ſtood upon his old plea, of having the Priſoners deliver'd him, and the Decrees Cancel'd. And on the Contrary, the Duke and Senate, reſolved not to betray their Temporal Authority, and renounce their Decrees, though as for the <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> at the earneſt intreaty of the <hi>French,</hi> they were willing in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to beſtow them upon King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and let him do with them as pleas'd him beſt; and when the Pope would recall his Cenſures, they were willing to do the ſame with their Letters or Proteſtation againſt them; but not before, leſt they might intimate that they had been in the falt and done amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Treaty is thus earneſtly carryed on by ſeveral Princes and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1607</label> their Ambaſſadors, the Pope erects a New Councel at <hi>Rome</hi> call'd <hi>La Congregation de Guerra,</hi> or the <hi>Congregation of War,</hi> conſiſting of XV. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals; out of whom he cull'd IV. to be imploy'd with the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> and the <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> of the Chamber, about the means to provide money, and moſt of theſe were of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction; the better to ingage that King to him, if the Tryal of the cauſe ſhould once be put to the Sword.</p>
                  <p>And it was the opinion of many, that it could not end without blows, for the Pope begins the year with new Levies: and the Count <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> who long'd for miſchief, caus'd the Drums to beat up at <hi>Milan</hi> for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; ſent to <hi>Switſerland,</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> to <hi>Germany,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to raiſe what Souldiers he could, getting Money and Arms from <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that he doubted not, preſently to be at the Head of XXX. Thouſand men. The hopes of theſe great Preparations animated the Pope ſo much, that, in a full <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> he declared, <hi>He would have war with the Republick of</hi> Venice.</p>
                  <p>In the Interim, the <hi>Venetians</hi> were not idle, haſtning their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as much as in them lay, ſo that in a little while they had got together about LXXX Gallies, rais'd many Thouſand foot in their own Territories, ſent to the <hi>Cantons</hi> to hire more, doubted not of Aſſiſtance
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:109877:320"/> from <hi>France,</hi> was promis'd aid from <hi>Great Brittain</hi> by Sr. <hi>Henry Wotten</hi> King <hi>James</hi> his Ambaſſador, by which means they had hopes from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and was promis'd ſupplyes from the <hi>Lorreiner,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>viz.</hi> the Count <hi>de Vaudemont,</hi> they hoped would be their General. But the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> being aged, ſo ſuperſtitiouſly fearful of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cenſures, beſide having a Son a Cardinal, who with the Pope did diſwade him, would not permit his Son to go, or any Levies to be made in his Dominions, though young Count <hi>de Vandemont,</hi> was willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough for the <hi>Venetian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Christendom</hi> is thus troubled with rumours of warrs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place buſie with great Preparations, to fill <hi>Europe</hi> full of miſchief and blood-ſhed, and all about an idle Humour of the Popes; The Treaty goeth on apace. And though many Embaſſies and Audiences had been been imploy'd to little purpoſe; yet the <hi>French</hi> King, will try the other pull, and ſo reſolves to imploy Cardinal <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> in this buſineſs; who being a Churchman might be more acceptable to the Pope, yet under the Command of the Inſtructions, might no way leſſen the rights of the Republick.</p>
                  <p>Thus qualified, <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> arrives at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he falls to work vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and willing he was to ſave the Popes Reputation and Credit: but after many Hearings and Debates, he could get only this Anſwer from the Senate, That the Cenſures being taken away, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call what they had done in Oppoſition to them, and ſend an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Rome;</hi> That for the <hi>Decrees,</hi> they would proceed in the uſe of them, with ſuch Moderation and Piety as they and their Anceſtors uſed to do. And that upon a Peace, the Eccleſiaſticks might return, only the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> excepted. And with theſe Anſwers, the Cardinal departs from <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee what good he could do there.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Joyeuſe</hi> found the Opinions divided ſome for a Peace upon any account, conſidering what a great miſchief a Rupture might bring upon Chriſtendom; others thought it not honourable for the Pope to recede from any thing he had done, till he had obtain'd what he deſired and made the Republick ſubmit. As for the Pope, though his greateſt hopes lay in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet he could not with reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too much on him, knowing his Coffers at that time to be empty, and if he did him any good he would expect a requital of ſome Priviledges, which would not be convenient for <hi>Rome</hi> to yeild to, beſides he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be over-power'd by the <hi>Venetians</hi> and their numerous Aſſiſtance; amongſt whom would be many of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once got a footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> might, in that juncture of time, give a blow at the very <hi>Papacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations perſwaded or forced the Pope to a Complyance, but yet was troubled that he could not come off with Honour, ſeeing the <hi>Venetians</hi> Anſwers were reſolute and cunningly worded, and they would not admit of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> upon any account whatever: and thus to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them who had ſuffer'd for his cauſe, would betray his Baffle to the whole world.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, after ſeveral Conſultations it was agreed on, that at <hi>Rome,</hi> Monſieur <hi>a' Alincourt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, ſhould demand of the Pope in the Name of the Chriſtian King and of the Republique, that the Cenſures might be taken away. And alſo that Cardinal <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> and <hi>d'Alincourt</hi> ſhould give him their words in the Name of their King, that the <hi>Decrees</hi> ſhould remain without Execution, until the Accord
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:109877:320" rendition="simple:additions"/> might be effected. To this laſt clauſe the Pope would have had added, that <hi>It was with the conſent of the Republick:</hi> But this was not yielded to, knowing the <hi>Venetians</hi> would never agree to ſuch an Addition. So, as much being done at <hi>Rome</hi> as could be, <hi>de Joyeuſe</hi> returns with the Papal Inſtructions and Authority to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Venice,</hi> the Cardinal hoping in ſome thing to uphold the Popes Honour, told the Senate, that now all the Difficulties were ſhrunk to two, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Cenſures were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But finding theſe would not be granted, he proceeds more moderately, and</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Before theſe were fully agreed on; there had been ſome diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner of the Ceremony, in taking off the <hi>Interdiction:</hi> for the Senate had abſolutely deny'd to receive <hi>Abſolution,</hi> affirming they were Innocent, and had (in what they had done) committed no falt: Then the Cardinal propoſed to go to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church with the Duke and Senate, and there to celebrate <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and give a <hi>Benediction</hi> which was enough (he ſaid) to intimate that the Cenſures were taken away.</p>
                  <p>But the Duke and Senate, jealous of their Reputation, would not allow of this; For though they confeſs'd, That the <hi>Apoſtolick Benediction</hi> ought not to be refuſed, when offer'd, yet at this time it might give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſome to believe a falſity, as if they had needed it by ſome falt in this Quarrel, alledging farther the Cuſtom of the Popes, who, if Princes do ſome acts to them through Devotion or Humility, preſently eſteem it as done of Duty, or in acknowledgment of their falts. At laſt, to end this Obſtacle, it was agreed on, as aboveſaid, <hi>That the Cardinal ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare without any other Ceremony that the Cenſures were taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now nothing remain'd undecided but the form of the <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> to null the Senate's Proteſtation againſt the <hi>Monitory</hi> or <hi>Interdict:</hi> but of this all was accepted, only this ſentence. <hi>The Cenſures being taken away the Proteſtation in like manner was taken away.</hi> The Cardinal urged, that they ought not to uſe the words <hi>Taken away</hi> in the Proteſtation, but <hi>Revoked.</hi> The Senate, though they affirm'd they could not comprehend, what ſubtilty or difference, laid in the alteration; yea for ſome time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to admit of a change. But perceiving the Cardinal would have it ſo, or elſe break all, at length yielded to the Cardinals requeſt, and ſo it was concluded thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cenſures being taken away, the Proteſtation in like manner is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Obſtacles thus removed, the Agreement was compleated with theſe Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>The XXI. of <hi>April</hi> in the morning, <hi>de Freſne</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador <note place="margin">The XI. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Engliſh Account.</note> being at the Cardinal <hi>de Joyeuſe</hi>'s Lodgings, <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Secretary had the two Priſoners <hi>Marc Antony Brandolino Valdemarino</hi> Abbot of <hi>Nerveſe,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Sarazin</hi> Canon of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> carryed thither. He telling the Ambaſſador, that theſe were the Priſoners, which the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Prince the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> had ſent to be deliver'd to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in gratification of the <hi>moſt Chriſtian</hi> King. But with <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> not to Prejudice hereby, the Authority the Republick hath to judg Eccleſiaſticks. The Ambaſſador anſwer'd <hi>That ſo he received them.</hi> Of which a publick Inſtrument being drawn, <hi>de Freſne</hi> went into a Gallery where the Cardinal was, ſent for the Priſoners, ſaying to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Theſe are the Priſoners that are to be deliver'd to the Pope;</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal pointing to one neer him, ſaid, <hi>Give them to him,</hi> meaning <hi>Claudio Montano</hi> (a Commiſſary ſent by the Pope to this effect) who touch'd them in token of Dominion and Poſſeſſion; and pray'd the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of

                     <hi>Juſtice</hi> who conducted them that they would be pleas'd to keep them for him.</p>
                  <p>This done, the Cardinal and Ambaſſador, went to the Colledg, where they met the Duke and Senat, and all being ſet as uſually, The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pronounced theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I rejoyce very much that this day, (ſo much deſired by me) is come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I declare unto your</hi> Serenitie <hi>that all the</hi> Cenſures <hi>are taken away, as indeed they are; and I take therein much pleaſure, for the benefit, which ſhall redound hereby to all</hi> Chriſtendom <hi>and particularly to</hi> Italy.</p>
                  <p>This ſaid, the Duke put into his hand, the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Revocation</hi> of their <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and after ſome words of Complement, they all roſe and departed; an end of this Quarrel being thus made.</p>
                  <p>That afternoon, a Rumour was ſpred about, that that mouring, at the meeting in the Colledg, the Cardinal had given an <hi>Abſolution.</hi> At this the <hi>Venetians</hi> (ſo jealous were they of their reputation) were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled, and made it their buſineſs to find out the Original of ſuch a Report, which at laſt they found to be ſcatter'd by ſome <hi>French-men,</hi> who giving for their aſſertion, only this Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cardinal being enter'd into the Colledg, before any thing was done, made the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> under his Hood. The idle ſtory and diſcontent vaniſh'd, the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſmiling to ſee, on what little things ſome fond people would build a Submiſſion or Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>And it may be, upon this Rumour, or ſome ſuch idle Report, ſome Hiſtorians do ſay, that they did receive Abſolution. But in this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I find moſt reaſon to rely upon the Credit of Father <hi>Paul.</hi> One of the moſt famous Pen-Champions that the <hi>Venetians</hi> imploy'd in this Quarrel, was the ſaid learned and judicious Fryer, of the Order of the <hi>Servi</hi> commonly known by the name of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom a word or two by the by.</p>
                  <p>He was born at <hi>Venice</hi> M. D. LII. He naturally addicted himſelf to his book, whereby when young, he gain'd great Reputation, ſo that <hi>William</hi> the famous Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> intertain'd him as his Chaplain, in the year M. D. LXXIX. he was created <hi>Provincial</hi> of his Order, which he executed without partiality: he went and lived ſome time at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he got acquainted with the beſt, his parts making him known, to Pope and Cardinals as well as others. Being return'd to <hi>Venice</hi> he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his ſtudies cloſe, and in all manner of learning was ſo excellent, that all Strangers that went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o <hi>Venice</hi> deſired his acquaintance, upon which he was fooliſhly accuſed by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as a Company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper with Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the Order of the <hi>Servi</hi> was in ſome trouble, by reaſon of their Protector, Cardinal <hi>Santa Severina,</hi> who againſt all right or reaſon, was reſolved to make one <hi>Gabriel Colliſon</hi> General of the <hi>Order,</hi> being thereto perſwaded by his Briberies: the whole <hi>Order</hi> oppoſed this, and herein Father <hi>Paul</hi> was a little ingaged, but carried himſelf with great diſcretion and moderation. But at laſt <hi>Gabriel</hi> was made <hi>General,</hi> and a ſeeming peace was made.</p>
                  <p>When the late Quarrel began between the Pope and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they choſe Father <hi>Paul,</hi> to be one of their chief Aſſiſtants, who by his ſolid reaſons ſtaggerd the Papal Pretenſions: which ſo concern'd the Pope, that he would have had the <hi>Father</hi> brib'd from his Duty to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:109877:322"/> but this failing, other deſigns were ſet on foot. <hi>Gaſpar Schoppius,</hi> a man well known for his railing and pernicious principles of Government, freely told Father <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Pope had long Hands, and might reach him, but wiſht rather to have him alive at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Father was by ſeveral great Perſonages informed, that Plots were laid againſt his Life: but he truſting to his Innocency neglected his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>But this confidence might have coſt him his Life, for one Evening in the Street at <hi>Venice,</hi> he was aſſaulted, received two wounds in his Neck and one in his Face, entring at his right ear and paſſing through the Jaw bone, and out again betwixt his Noſe and his Cheek, and the <hi>Stelletto</hi> was left ſticking in, the Villain not having ſtrength enough to pull it out.</p>
                  <p>The number of theſe <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> were five, who having a <hi>Gondola</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, got preſently to the Houſe of the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> then reſident in <hi>Venice;</hi> thence in a flat Boat, with Ten Oars and well armed, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the purpoſe, they departed that night, towards <hi>Ravenna.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the Papal Territories, they were ſecure, and vapour'd of the Fact, and were nobly received at every place; at laſt they got to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were well alſo entertain'd, with aſſignation of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. And here they ſtaid ſome time, till the world cryed ſhame, that ſuch abominable Villains ſhould be ſheltred and entertain'd from Juſtice, by his Holineſs: upon which the Pope, was forced for Honour ſake, to order their departure out of the City; yet had they ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance granted them, but ſo ſmall, in reſpect of thoſe Glories they expected, that they became mal-content, ſo that at laſt every one of them came to an evil end.</p>
                  <p>But to return to Father <hi>Paul,</hi> he was had home to his Monaſtery, the moſt famous Phyſicians and Chyrurgions in thoſe parts imploy'd about him, ſo that after ſome time he perfectly recovered, to the joy of the whole Senat, who by publick <hi>Proclamations</hi> took order for his future Security, aſſigning him a Guard, increaſe of Stipend, with a Houſe at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s at the publick Charge. But the Father deſired to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all ſuch ſtate, coſt, and trouble, reſolved to continue in his Monaſtery amongſt his Brethren of the <hi>Order.</hi> The Senate perceiving this to be his earneſt deſire, gratified him, but cauſed ſome building to be added to his Chamber, from whence by a little Gallery, he might have the Commodity to take Boat the better to avoid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, in his returns ſometimes by night, from the publick Service.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the Senat had thus carefully provided for his ſecurity, ſo that there was danger to uſe any more force, ſome other deſigns were ſet on foot, 1609. <hi>Fra. Antonio da viterbo</hi> who ſerved as an <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to the Father, was ſolicited, to make him away with a Razor, which he might conveniently do, conſidering his intimacy, and the great truſt the Father put in him, or if not this, to poyſon him. <hi>Antonio</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to act this wickedneſs himſelf, eſpecially to ſuch a good Friend and Patron, but would afford his Aſſiſtance if others would be the Actors. So at laſt it was concluded, that he ſhould take the Print in Wax of his Keys, which he ſhould deliver to another Fryar <hi>Giovar Franciſco,</hi> whom Fryar <hi>Bernardo</hi> (the Favourite of Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> Nephew to the Pope) had imploy'd about this thing; by which means having Counterfeit Keys, they might ſend in ſome Ruffians or <hi>Bravo</hi>'s to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father.</p>
                  <pb n="637" facs="tcp:109877:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>But ſome Letters of this Plot, by chance being taken, there was enough diſcovered, to have <hi>Franciſco</hi> and <hi>Antonio</hi> ſeiſed on. <hi>Franciſco</hi> was condemn'd to be hang'd, but had his pardon by a full diſcovery of the whole deſign, and delivering unto them all the Letters concerning this black Plot; what great Perſonages were in this action, is not known; the Councel of <hi>Venice</hi> thinking it beſt to conceal them, for the Honour of Religion.</p>
                  <p>To tell all the Attempts againſt him would be tedious, theſe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and againſt him it was that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> bent all their ſpight, he being an Enemy to the prop of all their Greatneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> their Uſurpations, and Authority over Temporal Princes; and his Reaſons obtain'd him the greater ill-will from that Biſhop, becauſe they ſeem'd to be favour'd by other Potentates: The Pope fearing that in time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Territories might follow the Example of the Venetians. And when his <hi>Coercive</hi> Authority is once deſpiſed, he will remain but a weak Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor within the narrow Limits of his Churches Patrimony; which may render him incapable of preferring his Favourites abroad; and the Intereſt thus gone, the Splendor of his Seat will fail; and the Glory of his idle and waſting Courtiers, will be eaten up, by the more thrifty Citizens. Thus their Charity to themſelves, made them the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent againſt the Fryar <hi>Paul</hi> though he acted nothing, but what became the duty of a good Subject to his Prince and Country.</p>
                  <p>The Father hoped, that the malice of his Enemies would vaniſh by degrees: and when Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. dyed, he expected all heart-burning to ceaſe, but here he found himſelf miſtaken, and the Quarrel and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity intail'd as it were upon the Pontifick Chair. For <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. ſucceeding, 1621, bare the ſame ill-will, looking upon the Father as the chief-Counſellor, nay and Incendiary too of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he told their Ambaſſador, that, <hi>there would never be a peace between the Republick and the See Apoſtolick, but ſuch an one as Father</hi> Paul <hi>ſhould approve of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Father informed of this, was grieved beyond meaſure, that he ſhould be held a <hi>Beautefeu,</hi> and ſo rather than any difference ſhould ariſe about him, reſolved peaceably to retire himſelf from his own Country. To live amongſt the <hi>Protestants,</hi> might expoſe himſelf to Calumnies; to dwell where the Eccleſiaſticks might over-power him, or where the Temporality would not trouble it ſelf in his Protection, was to expoſe his Life to Poyſon and Stellettoes again. Upon this difficulty he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to reſide at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or ſome of the Eaſtern Countryes. And for this Peregrination he began to make Preparations, take advice, get ſafe-conducts, &amp;c.

                  <p>And now he began to be ancient and feeble, and dyed in his Monaſtery at <hi>Venice,</hi> with great Tranquility and Settlement of mind, 1623. in the LXXI. year of his Age.</p>
                  <p>The Father was little, humble, grave, but withal chearful; of his dyet very ſparing, inſomuch, that every day with him, was almoſt a Faſt: he was merciful and good to his greateſt Enemies, begging Pardon for thoſe, who deſigned his death.</p>
                  <p>His Learning got him renown every where, being good for the <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Languages, beſides <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and other <hi>Europaean;</hi> was famous for his skill in <hi>Mathematicks, Phyſick, Anatomy, Chymiſtry, Aſtronomy:</hi> in all which he was a dayly Practitioner and Diſcoverer of many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

                  <p>He had alſo carefully peruſed all the ancient Philoſophers, out of whom he had collected their different Opinions.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were accuſed of having ſome knowledg of it, and to this purpoſe was call'd to mind the Sermon of Father <hi>Hardy;</hi> preached at St. <hi>Severins</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> not two Months before the Blow; in which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things he told his Auditors—<hi>That Kings heaped up Treaſures to make themſelves fear'd, but yet there needed but a Blow a or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock to kill a King:</hi> and 'tis known, that none was more gathering and hoarding up of Moneys in his latter days, to carry on his Armed deſign, than this King, inſomuch that they talk of Mountains of Gold that he had amaſs'd together.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo objected, that <hi>Ravaillac</hi> declared, he had inform'd Father <hi>d'Aubigny</hi> of this intended Murther, and ſhew'd him the Knife, but that this was told him in <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and ſo not to be reveal'd: the cunning <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> upon Examination, proteſting, <hi>that God had given him that Grace or Quality, that as ſoon as any thing was reveal'd to him in</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>he preſently forgot it.</hi>

                  <p>But however it be, the reverend <hi>Hardovin de Perefixe</hi> the preſent Arch biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> doth aſſure us, that the Conſtancy, hardineſs and unconcernedneſs of the Malefactor at his exquiſite Torments in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring—<hi>strongly confirm'd the ſuſpicion had that certain</hi> Emiſſaries <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask of Religion had inſtructed and charmed him, with falſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances that he ſhould dye a</hi> Martyr, <hi>if he kil'd him; whom they made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was the ſworn Enemy of the Church</hi>—The truth is, after the Villain had given the murdring blows, he neither took care to flee, to conceal his Knife, or ſhift for himſelf: but ſtood ſtill by the Coach, as if he deſired to be taken notice of, and glorified, and prided himſelf in ſuch a noble Exploit.</p>
                  <p>And that there was ſome Secret more than ordinary diſcovered in his Examination and Confeſſion; and that thoſe who inſtigated him to that bloody action were ſuch, that it was not thought fitting (whether for the Honour of Religion, or ſome other reſpect) that they ſhould be publickly known, is more than hinted at, by the foreſaid Prelate:

                  <p>The Rebels thus fortified with the Pope's Bleſſing, never doubted but with the fame of this Benediction ſo to encreaſe their numbers, as to be able to carry all before them, and utterly free themſelves from their obedience.

But this he refuſed, offering to redeem them with Money: <hi>But to be falſe to his Maſter the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>or to betray the Catholique Cauſe, he never would,</hi> as he ſaid. Upon which, ſeeing no good to be done on him, his Twelve men were alſo executed.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all theſe great and noble Succeſſes of the Loyalliſts, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels would not abſolutely give over their wickedneſs, though their main ſecurity were ſome beggarly lurking-places in Boggs and Woods. But that which render'd them ſo ſtubborn, was the great confidence they had in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, which indeed had come to their relief, if the loſs of <hi>Dunboy</hi> had not ſo much diſcouraged the Catholique King, who upon notice of its taking, ſent into <hi>Gallicia</hi> to <hi>Carrazena</hi> Governour of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runna,</hi> to ſtop the Army and other Neceſſaries for <hi>Ireland,</hi> conſidering the place where he expected to land them, was taken.</p>
                  <p>One of the chief Incendiaries among them at this time, was their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Roſs, Owen Mac Eggan,</hi> or as ſome call him, <hi>Eugenius O-Hegan,</hi> who by his pretended Dignity, as <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> his favour and credit with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Intereſt with their Clergy, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by the Pope to diſpoſe of all the Eccleſiaſtical Livings in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and other Favours he enjoyed, carryed a great ſtroke amongſt the people, commanding and ruling all as he pleaſed: and ſuch was his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt obedient Subjects (were they <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Romanists)</hi> that all that he could any ways ſeize on, he would in piety (as he pretended) firſt have them confeſſed and abſolved, and then preſently in his own ſight murdered; and this he eſteemed a notable ſign of Catholique Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>At laſt it was the fortune of the Loyalliſts to meet with a Party of the Rebels, in which Conflict this furious <hi>Mac Hegan</hi> commanded an hundred Horſe, himſelf leading them on with his Sword drawn in one <note place="margin">January 1602/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <q>For Age I am not ſo unſerviceable, nor of Body ſo unable, neither in Courage ſo dejected, but that my faithful Service in her behalf may expiate and make ſome meaſure of ſatisfaction for theſe my many and diſloyal Rebellions.</q>

                              <p>I. The one is, <hi>Whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Catholiques to favour the foreſaid Prince</hi> Hugh <hi>with Arms and all other means in this Warr?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>II. The other is, <hi>Whether it be lawful for the ſame Catholiques to fight againſt the foreſaid Prince, without deadly ſin, and to favour the</hi> Engliſh <hi>in this Warr, by Arms, or by any other means whatſoever?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Eſpecially, when the caſe ſo ſtands, that if they deny this kind of help unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to a manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their lives, or the loſing of their Temporal goods. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſince it is permitted by the Pope, that they may obey the foreſaid Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and acknowledg her as their lawful Queen, by paying Tribute unto her: for it ſeemeth that, that may be performed what belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Subjects to do, <hi>viz.</hi> To fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen's Rebels, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their due obedience to her, and ſeem to uſurp the Land which is ſubject to her dominion.</p>
                              <pb n="668" facs="tcp:109877:338"/>
                              <p>That both theſe Queſtions may be decided, we muſt hold as for certain, That the Pope hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bridle and ſuppreſs thoſe who forſake the Faith, and thoſe who fight againſt the Catholick Faith; when by no other means ſo great a miſchief can be hindred.</p>
                              <p>And furthermore, it muſt be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively concluded, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> doth oppugn the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion, and doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from the publick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Catholique Faith; And that for this cauſe, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prince <hi>O-Neal,</hi> and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (mentioned in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Letters of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII.) undertook the Warr againſt her. Theſe things thus laid down, the firſt Queſtion is eaſily reſolved.</p>
                              <p>For without doubt, any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick whatſoever may favour the ſaid Prince <hi>Hugh O-Neil</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid warr, and this with great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and certain hopes of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reward: For ſeeing that the ſaid Prince doth make Warr by the Pope's Authority for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Catholique Religion, and that the Pope doth exhort all the faithful by his Letters thereunto (as is manifeſt by his Letters), and that he will extend his graces upon the favourers of the Prince in that Warr, in as ample manner as if they make warr againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> No man in juſtice can doubt, but that the preſent Warr is lawful, and alſo that to fight for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion (which is the greateſt good of all others) is a matter of great merit.</p>
                              <p>And concerning the ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it is moſt certain, that all thoſe Catholiques do ſin mortally, that take part with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foreſaid Prince <hi>O-Neil,</hi> Neither can they obtain Eternal Salvation, nor be abſolved from their ſins by any Prieſt, unleſs they firſt repent and forſake the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. And the ſame is to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:109877:338" rendition="simple:additions"/> of thoſe, who in this War favour the <hi>Engliſh</hi> either by Arms, or any other means; or ſhall give them any thing of like Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides thoſe accuſtomed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which is lawful for them (by virtue of the Pope's Indulgence and Permiſſion) to pay unto the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the Catholick Religion flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and being amongſt them.</p>
                              <p>This Aſſertion is confirm'd by this moſt manifeſt Reaſon.</p>
                              <p>Becauſe it is ſufficiently proved by the Pope's Letters, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> and her Forces, make unjuſt Warr againſt the ſaid Prince <hi>O-Neal,</hi> and thoſe who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him.</p>
                              <p>For ſeeing that the Pope doth declare, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do fight againſt the Catholique Religion, and that therefore the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be reſiſted as much as if they were <hi>Turks;</hi> and that he doth beſtow the ſame Graces and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon thoſe who reſiſt the ſaid <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as he doth upon thoſe who fight againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> Who doubteth but that the Warr waged by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Army, is altogether unjuſt? But it is not lawful for any to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour an unjuſt Warr, or to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereat, under the pain of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe Catholiques do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt grievouſly offend, who bear Arms with the Hereticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foreſaid Prince, in a Warr ſo apparently impious and unjuſt. And ſo do all thoſe who aſſiſt them in the ſaid Warr with Arms, Victuals, or by any other means, which of themſelves do further the proceedings of the Warr, and cannot give account of their indifferent obedience.</p>
                              <p>Neither doth it any thing avail them to ſcandal the <hi>Apoſtolical Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of Surreption, or of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand procuring. For <hi>Surreption</hi> cannot happen, where no Petition
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:109877:339"/> of them is declared, in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they were diſpatched. But the Pope doth plainly declare in thoſe Letters, that he and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had voluntarily exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Princes, and all others of the Faithful, to undertake this Warr. And, the better to incite them to it, doth enrich them with great Favours, Bleſſings, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. How can it then be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that theſe Letters were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious, which only contain an Exhortation ſtrengthned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Favours for ſuch as did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them.</p>
                              <p>Neither therefore can the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques who aſſiſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> defend themſelves by the Reaſons alledged in the ſecond Queſtion: For no mortal ſin is to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although thereby Life or Goods might be ſaved: but theſe things which further and help to execute an unjuſt Warr, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly deadly ſins.</p>
                              <p>It is permitted likewiſe to the Catholiques, to perform ſuch kind of Obedience to this Haeretical Queen, as doth not oppugn the Catholique Religion. Neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was it, or could it be the meaning of the Pope, to allow them to uſe that Obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Queen, which doth manifeſtly contradict and oppoſe the end and ſcope which he had to promote the Catholick Faith and Religion in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But that this was his meaning and ſcope, his own Letters or <hi>Breves</hi> do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare.</p>
                              <p>From all which it remaineth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently apparent, that the moſt famous Prince <hi>Hugh O-Neil,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholiques in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warr againſt an Heretical Queen (who oppoſeth her ſelf againſt the True Faith) are by no means Rebels, neither do they deny due obedience, or unjuſtly uſurp any of the Queens Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But on the contrary, they do
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:109877:339" rendition="simple:additions"/> rather vindicate themſelves and their Countrey from an impious and wicked Tyranny, by a moſt juſt Warr; and do defend and maintain the holy and Orthodox Faith with all their power, as becometh all Chriſtians and Catholicks ſo to do.</p>
                              <p>All and every of which, we whoſe Names are under-written, do judg and approve as moſt certain and true.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> (as aforeſaid) having ſubmitted himſelf, the Lord Deputy carried him the next day to <hi>Dublin,</hi> intending to convey him into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and thither he carried him, King <hi>James</hi> being proclaimed and received as the undoubted King, who alſo pardoned <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> received him honourably at Court, and by Proclamation forbidding any to ſhew him the leaſt diſreſpect.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhew themſelves of another temper: for hearing of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> death (a great comfort to <note n="*" place="margin">Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. of <hi>Eng.</hi> part 1. an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Epiſt.

The Citizens of <hi>Lymrick,</hi> with their Prieſts, ſeized upon all the Churches in the City, erecting their <hi>Altars,</hi> reſolving to re-ſettle their Religion again. At <hi>Wexford</hi> they gave out, that King <hi>James</hi> was <note place="margin">

Thoſe of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſecured the Cathedral Church to themſelves, defaced the <hi>Seſſion-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> by breaking the Doors, pulling down the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Seats of Juſtice, ordering <hi>Maſſes</hi> to be celebrated publikely.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe of <hi>Cork</hi> went farther, refuſing to proclaim the King, ran to their Arms, forbad the Commiſſioners to proclaim him; upon which the Loyalliſts and the ſaid Commiſſioners were forced to proclaim him upon an Hill near the Town. They entertained one amongſt them, who call'd himſelf a <hi>Legat</hi> from the Pope, went with them in Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, new hallowed their Churches, kept ſtrong Guards, took the Sacrament to ſpend their Lives and Goods in the defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; fell upon the Kings Forces, encouraged a Prieſt to hearten the people on, by preaching to them, That <hi>James</hi> could not be a lawful King, becauſe he was not appointed by the Pope, and ſworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. They write alſo to all Towns and Cities, to aſſiſt them in defence of the Catholick Faith; and the better to carry on their Deſigns, ſeized upon the King's Munition.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> having ſtaid a little time in <hi>England,</hi> with leave and Reward he return'd for <hi>Ireland;</hi> where after ſo many Promiſes
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:109877:340" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Obligations, it was expected he would have lived civilly and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. But here, according to his old wont, he falleth a plotting and contriving miſchief again, but with a great deal of ſecreſie.

                  <p>And here I might ſpeak at large of the ſeveral Deſigns as well of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> as <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to hinder King <hi>James</hi> from his true ſucceſſion to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> as ſometimes endeavouring to make him odious to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to prevent her declaring for him; as by telling her of the King's intimacy with <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. which they endeavoured to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1599</label> make out to her by a Letter of his to the ſaid Biſhop; a thing, had it been true, might not have deſerved ſuch a Cenſure as Deprivation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope may be as civilly treated with, as other Potentates; a thing not to be denied by any but an Impertinent <hi>Puritan,</hi> or an Irrational <hi>Enthuſiaſtick:</hi> But they hoped, that her Jealouſie of Religion, augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Age, and ſome Expreſſions in the Letter, might perſwade her to make Mountains of Mole-hills, and in ſuch a pet to declare ſome other to the Crown; which, as ſome hoped, might have brought ſuch troubles upon the Kingdom, that in the hurry a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> might have ſlipt himſelf into the Throne, to which ſo many pretended.</p>
                  <p>But ſhe was too wiſe to be cheated by ſuch Toys; preſently ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the drift, ſhe ſuſpected the cheat. And a meer forgery it was in reſpect of King <hi>James;</hi> though his knaviſh Secretary, <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Propende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret animo ad Religionem Romanam <hi>Rob. Johnston</hi> Hiſt. Rerum <hi>Brit.</hi> p. 448.</note> one warping towards Popery, had given ſome ground for ſuch a ſtory: For he, by the Inſtigation of his Kinſman, Sir <hi>Edward Drummond,</hi> a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> had penn'd a Letter to the ſaid <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. in favour of the Biſhop of <hi>Vaiſon,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi>-man, for his preferment to a Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which by ſhuffling in among other Letters to be ſigned, the King had haſtily (a dangerous overſight, where are knaviſh Secretaries) ſet his hand to; the other ſealing it with the Royal Signet, entruſted to him by his Office.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the by challenged King <hi>James</hi> with this. But he proteſted his Innocency, by denying any ſuch thing; ſo did <hi>James El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phingſton</hi> Lord <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> who alſo got <hi>Drummond</hi> to forſwear it. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and other Enemies to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Title, could then proceed no farther, though they had uſed ſuch Intereſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to get a Copy of it, which they ſhew'd to the Queen as the Original, and ſhe to Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Foulis</hi> the King's Agent; who ſatisfied her Majeſty, by proving to her, by the Teſtimony of her Stationers, that the <hi>Date</hi> of the Letter was older than the ſtamp or mark of the Paper; whereby it could not be the Original, and ſo might be a Cheat as well as a Copy. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat. Tort.</hi> pag. 47. 1608, 1609.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> retorting this Letter to the King, <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> was farther examined and tried, who confeſt all, was condemned of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as a Traytor to be beheaded; but by Queen <hi>Ann's</hi> Interceſsion was pardoned. A man he was of good Parts; but eſpecially knew how to filch, pilfer, and embezel Church-Lands; and if it ſhould be poſsible for a covetous man (as he was) to be honeſt, yet 'tis certain, that he who robs God and the Church, can never be a Friend to the King, but for his own Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is now old and weak, cannot live long; ſo 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to attempt any more againſt her Perſon, whoſe death they daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and it might anticipate their quickeſt Deſigns. No man's right and ſucceſsion to the Crown is ſo much fear'd as that of King <hi>James;</hi> and therefore to prevent Him, muſt be the main Care and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Francis Mawbray,</hi> Son to the Laird of <hi>Barnebowgall,</hi> who had lived ſome while in the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Court at <hi>Bruxels;</hi> he, they <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1601</label> ſay, undertook to take this rub out out of the way, by killing the King;
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:109877:342" rendition="simple:additions"/> to which purpoſe he intends for <hi>Scotland,</hi> but taketh <hi>England</hi> in his way. At <hi>London</hi> one <hi>Daniel</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Fencing-Maſter, diſcovers the Plot to the Queen; ſhe for a further trial hath them both ſeiz'd on and ſent into <hi>Scotland: Mawbry,</hi> ſuppoſed guilty, is caſt into <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, whence thinking one night to eſcape out of a Window, by his Bed-ſheets, which proving too ſhort, he fell upon the Rocks, and ſo dyed; his Body was hang'd for ſome time, then quartered, and fixt upon the Gates, and ſeveral places of the City.</p>
                  <p>This failing, another Deſign is in hand: In <hi>Italy, Ferdinando</hi> I. the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> by the intercepting of ſome Letters, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Plot to take away King <hi>James</hi> his Life by Poyſon. The Duke, who had formerly been a Cardinal, moved with the Fame of the King's Learning and Virtue, and it may be had ſome hopes of his Converſion, upon the former falſe Letters, reſolved to diſcover and prevent it. At this time Mr. <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> ſojourned in <hi>Florence,</hi> and was well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1602</label> with Signior <hi>Vietta,</hi> the Duke's Secretary; upon whoſe Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Wotton</hi> is pitched on to be the Meſſenger. The Letters and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Antidotes againſt Poyſon (ſuch as were not then known in <hi>Scotland)</hi> were delivered to him, who diſguiſed under an <hi>Italian</hi> Garb and Name of <hi>Octavio Baldi,</hi> haſteth to <hi>Scotland,</hi> cometh to the King, diſcovereth himſelf and the Conſpiracy, and after ſome ſtay returneth to <hi>Florence.</hi> He was afterwards Knighted by King <hi>James,</hi> and famous for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Languages, and Embaſſies.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Deſigns againſt the King's right to the Throne, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. was not wanting, who intended the Crown for ſome of his Friends. <note place="margin">Card. <hi>D'Oſſat</hi> Let. 191. 268. 272.</note> And perceiving that ſome in <hi>England</hi> were tampering to promote the Intereſt of the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> in this caſe he thought it beſt to deal warily: He had a mind that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> ſhould enjoy the Crown; but this upon better thoughts he ſuppoſed would not be feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by reaſon that <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Intereſt might be too ſtrong. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Parma</hi> being married, he caſts another way about, and thinks upon Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> younger Brother to <hi>Parma;</hi> who being unmarried, might be wedded to <hi>Arabella,</hi> and ſo did not queſtion by their joint Forces and Intereſts to carry the Crown. To carry on this buſineſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was thought more convenient, than to unite all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that their Cauſe might not ſuffer by any diſſentions amongſt themſelves about this Succeſſion. And ſeeing Experience had told them, That their Clergy had a great awe and authority over the Laity, ſo it was beſt then to have all their Clergy to be of the ſame mind, and to proſecute the ſame Ends, and they hoped that their Laity would not then be divided. To which purpoſe they conclude of an <hi>Arch-Prieſt,</hi> who ſhould have a Juriſdiction over the reſt, who were to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Rules and Inſtructions. And in theſe Deſigns, Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> was a main Stickler and Contriver; the Pope alſo had drawn up ſome <hi>Bulls,</hi> and ſent to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to divulge and ſpread them abroad at convenient time; wherein he declared, That not any, though never ſo near in <note n="*" place="margin">—Quantum cun<expan>

To this end many Plots had been contrived againſt Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and King <hi>James.</hi> But they failing, a more deſperate is pitch'd on, and this was, With one Blow to deſtroy King, Queen, Princes, Biſhops, Nobles, and Commons, who were not of their Perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>This is concluded feaſible, by blowing up the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> where they or their Repreſentees meet. To this purpoſe <hi>Piercy</hi> hireth an Houſe adjoining, intending by that means to undermine it; which Mine being ſtuft with Gunpowder and other Materials, would not fail of Execution. But firſt, they take an Oath of Secrecy in an Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind St. <hi>Clements</hi> Church without <hi>Temple-Barr.</hi>

                  <p>This done, they went into a more private Chamber, heard <hi>Maſs,</hi> and received the Sacrament from one <hi>William Gerard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, To work they fall, and in ſome time had wrought under a little Entry to the Wall of the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> under-propping it with Wood as they proceeded. But at laſt, occaſion offering it ſelf, they hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Convenient Cellar</hi> juſt under the Houſe, into which they conveyed Thirty ſix Barrels of Powder, over which they laid a Thouſand Billets, and Five hundred Fagots, with ſome Stones and Iron Barrs.</p>
                  <p>Things thus fitted, they expect the day of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſitting, which from time to time had been put off till the Fifth of <hi>November:</hi> In the mean time they conſult how to ſeiſe on the Prince <hi>(Henry)</hi> if he ſhould not be at the Houſe. As for <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> (after King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr) <hi>Piercy</hi> undertook to ſurpriſe him, whom with his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> they reſolve to diſpatch out of the World; yet the better to bring their Ends about, they thought good to center their
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:109877:349"/> hopes in one of the Royal Blood; and this muſt be the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (afterwards married to the <hi>Palſgrave),</hi> whom they would bring up, and marry according to their Intereſts; thinking thereby alſo to oblige many of the Nobility to their Cauſe, upon hopes of having her to Wife, and with her the Crown. She was now at <hi>Comb,</hi> the Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Warwich-ſhire;</hi> where to ſecure her, they contrived a great Hunting-Match to be the Sixth of <hi>November</hi> on <hi>Dunſmore-Heath;</hi> under which pretence many <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would meet well Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and ſurpriſe her by force.</p>
                  <p>As for a preſent ſupply of Moneys, Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> promiſed Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred pounds, Mr. <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> Two thouſand pounds, and <hi>Piercy</hi> all that he could get of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) his Rents, which was about Four thouſand pounds. They alſo contrived how to keep the Slander of ſuch a Villany from themſelves and Religion; ſo determined to throw the Crime upon the <hi>Puritans</hi> (a ſort of people bad enough of themſelves, that we need not load them with other mens Faults) by declaring them to be the Traytors who blew up the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>To carry on which falſe report, they had framed a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which they had got printed, and ready for publiſhing upon the Sign given, which they ſuppreſt, and burnt upon the diſcovery, though ſome of them by chance came to view, and were ſeen and read by Dr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> Dean of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Ellis</hi> Recorder of the ſaid City, and other perſons. And the better alſo to get the ſame Credit with the people, <hi>Keys</hi> (Brother-in-law to Mr. <hi>Pickering)</hi> had a few days before either borrowed or bought the ſwift Horſe (well known in <hi>London,</hi> and thereabouts) of Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> of <hi>Tichmarch-grove</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> (a noted <hi>Puritan,</hi> whom they alſo deſigned to kill), upon which <hi>Faux</hi> (having fired the Match and Touchwood leading to the Train) was to eſcape, as they bore him in hand; but their deſign was to kill him at his taking Horſe, for <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Man; which the people would eaſily believe, ſeeing the Horſe, ſo well known to them; and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude once perſwaded of this, would be more facil to joyn with them, under notion of doing Juſtice upon ſuch ſuppoſed Traytors and Wretches.</p>
                  <p>They alſo conſult how to keep the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Lords from going that day to Parliament, the better to ſtrengthen their Cauſe by their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in the height of all their hopes and expectations, a diſcovery is made thus:</p>

                     <hi>Monteagle</hi> wondred at the Letter and its delivery; and thinking it might relate to ſome miſchief, thought it his duty to make it known: ſo away he goeth to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> ſhews it to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, who tells ſome other of the Privy-Council of it; and the King being returned from his Hunting at <hi>Royſton,</hi> they deliver it to Him.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty, having ſeriouſly conſidered it, and all other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; concluded, that it might relate to ſome Deſign to blow up the Parliament; and in this jealouſie ordered the Rooms and Vaults about the Houſe to be ſearched; which was done the night before the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when in the foreſaid <hi>Cellar</hi> under the <hi>Lords-Houſe,</hi> were found the Barrels of Powder, and at the door ſtanding <hi>Guido Faux</hi> booted and ſpurr'd, with a large <hi>Dark-Lanthorn</hi> (now to be ſeen in <hi>Oxford</hi> Library) with Matches, Tinder-Box, and other Materials for his Deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faux</hi> was preſently carried to Court and examined, where he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſturdy and ſcornful, maintaining the Deſign to be lawful, That <hi>James</hi> was not his King, becauſe an Heretick; was ſorry that the Plot fail'd, and that he had not blown up the Houſe, with himſelf, and thoſe who were ſent to ſearch; affirming, That God would have had the Plot conceal'd, but it was the Devil who reveal'd it. At laſt, <hi>Faux</hi> himſelf confeſt all that he knew of the Treaſon. Thus far diſcovered, the King ſuſpecting ſome Commotions or Riſings, ſent with all ſpeed to prevent them by timely notice by <hi>Lepton</hi> and others. This was that Mr. <hi>John Lepton</hi> of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> who rid ſo often betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> in one Week, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1606; who though he won his Wager, yet was a Loſer, never getting his winnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piercy, Wright.</hi> &amp;c. who now lurked about <hi>London</hi> to expect the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blow, informed of the diſcovery, take Horſe, making what haſte they can to their Companions, appointed to be at the Rendezvous on <hi>Dunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> In brief, according to their abilities they run into open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, but to their own Deſtruction. The High-Sheriffs, with other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Loyal Subjects, ſo hunting them, that they were either all diſperſed, ſlain, or taken, and the chief of them afterwards condemned and executed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> (whoſe Obſervations and Principles are not always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable) <note place="margin">Memoires of K. <hi>James,</hi> pag. 38.</note> tells us, that <hi>his Catholique Majeſty ſent an</hi> Agent <hi>on purpoſe
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:109877:350"/> to congratulate King</hi> James <hi>his great preſervation: A flattery ſo palpable, as the Pope could not refrain</hi> laughing <hi>in the face of Cardinal</hi> D'Oſſat, <hi>when he firſt told it him.</hi> Thus he.</p>
                  <p>This Agent was <hi>Don Juan de Mendoza,</hi> who brought very rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents with him. Whether it was <hi>Flattery,</hi> or Hypocriſie, or no, is no great matter; it being the cuſtom of Princes, though Enemies, to uſe ſuch Ceremonies. And I can tell him farther, That a little after the Plot, a ſudden report being ſpread that King <hi>James</hi> was kill'd; and Sir <hi>Lewis Lewkenor,</hi> then <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> being ſent by the Council to certifie the Forreign Miniſter, of the King's ſafety and health, <hi>Don Pedro de Cunigo,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>London,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt mad for joy; and for the good News, preſented Sir <hi>Lewis</hi> with a great Gold Chain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Legendiaries</hi> will tell us of ſeveral men ſpeaking after their heads were cut off; and <hi>Turrianus</hi> the Jeſuit will make <hi>Clemens,</hi> ſeveral years after he knew that St <hi>James</hi> was dead, yet to write an Epiſtle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the ſaid St. <hi>James:</hi> And <hi>Osborn</hi> here doth much follow the ſame wonders, by telling us that this ſtory is teſtified by Cardinal <hi>D' Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat,</hi> whereas that Cardinal was dead above a year before the Powder-Plot hapned. Another miſtake he hath, ſaying, That the Pope <hi>laught</hi> at the <hi>Flattery;</hi> whereas Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">Les Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades &amp; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, par <hi>Caeſar Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> l. 3. p. 450</note> 
                     <hi>Perron</hi> (who was the man that told the Pope of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſy for <hi>England)</hi> ſaith, his Holineſs was diſpleaſed at the Hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>But to return: What was the extent of this Treaſon, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were aſſiſtants to it, is difficult to diſcover. Certain it is, that ſome of the Nobility were ſuſpected, impriſoned, or fined, or call'd in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for not coming up at that time to Parliament.</p>
                  <p>About this time they ſent over Sir <hi>Edmond Baynham</hi> to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. And Father <hi>Parſons</hi> Rector of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledg there, orders the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to pray—<hi>For the Intention of their Father Rector;</hi> which made ſome of them wonder what could be the meaning of ſuch an unuſual Prayer, not knowing what his Intention was. But being afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the diſcovery of the Plot, Sixteen of them (abhorring ſuch jugling and bloody Deſigns) forſook the Colledg, ſlipt into <hi>France,</hi> ſome of them turning to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whither they came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Guido Faux</hi> himſelf had been alſo with the Pope, and conſulted with the aforeſaid <hi>Parſons;</hi> and it is affirmed by the voluntary Confeſſion of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Bp. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drows</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſ. ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> c. 5. pag. 113.</note> a Jeſuit, That at this time there were three Bulls procured from the Pope, and ready upon this occaſion; and ſhould have been publiſhed, had the Powder done the intended Execution; but that failing, they were ſuppreſt.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Netherlands, Hugh Owen</hi> (an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traitor) was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, highly commending the Contrivance; and ſo did <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Baldwin,</hi> the Legier Jeſuit in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who ſome years afterwards was apprehended at <hi>Baſil,</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> as he was in diſguiſe ſtealing into <hi>Italy.</hi> He was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> where he laid ſome years in the Tower, and at laſt was delivered at the deſire of <hi>Gondemar</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, whoſe Cunning did ſometimes out-maſter the Court-Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. As for <hi>Baldwin,</hi> he dyed at <hi>Omers</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> 1632.</p>
                  <p>About this time in <hi>Spain,</hi> lived as Legier for their Cauſe, <hi>Arthur Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi> who after his turning Jeſuit, call'd himſelf <hi>Joſeph Creſwell,</hi> the only man, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaid, he ever heard of to change his

                  <p>As for <hi>Portugal, Thomas Robinſon</hi> (who belonged to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent at <hi>Lisbon)</hi> affords us this Obſervation.—<hi>Henry Flood,</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, <note place="margin">Anatomy of the <hi>Eng.</hi> Nun. at <hi>Lisb.</hi> p. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>How long this Conſpiracy had been on the Anvil, is hard to ſay. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> layeth the foundation of it on the Popes <hi>Breves</hi> (1600) that were ſent over to exclude King <hi>James,</hi> or any other that ſhould not maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. And <hi>Catesby</hi> himſelf laid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt force and confirmation upon them. For when in conference Father <hi>Garnet</hi> ſeem'd to deſire that the Pope's conſent might be obtain'd; <hi>Catesby</hi> anſwered, That he took that as granted by the Pope in his <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Breves</hi> before: <hi>for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if it were not lawful to receive or repell him, the ſaid</hi> Bulls <hi>or</hi> Breves <hi>do import; then is it lawful alſo to expel or caſt him out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it appears by the Confeſſions of <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> that in the firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> 1603, the Plot was more fully agreed on, and the blowing up of the Parliament-Houſe by Powder, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; from which time, till its diſcovery, they continually had their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitators and Councils to promote the Cauſe, and carry on the Work, with all vigour and ſecreſie.</p>
                  <p>What number of them were engaged in it in <hi>England,</hi> I know not; nor did there appear above an hundred in a Body: but that others had ſome hints or notice of it, is more than probable. And it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that that very morning (viz. <hi>November</hi> V.) the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> at <hi>Rowington</hi> went to <hi>Warwick</hi> and rang the Bells. And the ſame Night <hi>Grant,</hi> with ſome others, went to the Stable of <hi>Warwick</hi>-Caſtle, took away the Horſes thence, rid two miles off to <hi>Norbrook (Grant</hi>'s Houſe) where <hi>Rockwood</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Wife, with ſome others of the ſame ſtamp met, to rejoyce with them for the downfall of Hereſie; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging their Husbands to go on, encreaſe their Forces, and fight it out to the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor need we ſuppoſe, that their Prieſts and Jeſuits in <hi>England</hi> were idle in this grand Affair, which had been ſo long in hammering amongſt them. We meet with <hi>Hammond</hi> the Jeſuit very active, not only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to Cruelty, but alſo after it was diſcovered to confeſs and abſolve at one time about Twenty of the Rebels at <hi>Robert Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Honſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Greenwell</hi> (alias <hi>Teſmond)</hi> another Jeſuit, was ſo zealous in this holy Cauſe, that when he knew the Plot was known, he call'd Father <hi>Hall</hi> a <hi>Flegmatick Fellow,</hi> becauſe he thought him not active enough to advance the Rebellion; and in this fury hurried himſelf down into
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:109877:351"/> 
                     <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to ſee what troubles he would raiſe there, by falſly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he went along, That there was a deſign to cut all the throats of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was the ſaid Father <hi>Hall</hi> (alias <hi>Oldcorne)</hi> a Jeſuit eager enough for the Plot, encouraging Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> with the juſtneſs of the Deſign, however the Event was: Inſtancing, how the <hi>Turks</hi> ſometimes beat the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that the Eleven Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were twice overcome, though God himſelf had commanded them to go and fight againſt <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.</hi>

                  <p>However, there are ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would gladly have the world believe all this to be but a meer cheat, only to be a Trick of <hi>Salisbury</hi> the then Secretary; and for proof, I have had the patience and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear a ſtory very gravely told, How one lurking under the Council-Table, (and upon what jealouſie came he there?) conceal'd by the long Carpet, heard much of the Contrivance. A Tale ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, that to endeavour its confutation, would argue one more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent than the Tale-teller.</p>
                  <p>But, though this ſtory might be falſe, yet will they have <hi>Cecyl</hi> to be the Plotter, and to draw theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> into it; as if (ſuppoſing this were true) they were not guilty, and Traytors. Can you deny but that they themſelves thought the Plot lawful and juſt? That accordingly they really intended it? And would have done it, if not prevented? If <hi>Cecyl</hi> occaſioned it, he muſt uſe ſome Means and Inſtruments; and who and what they were, is a wonder that they were not diſcovered and known before now: Thoſe who were Executed, accuſed no body; and as the Poet ſaith well,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>HENRY GARNET</hi> was born in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> 1555, of Gentile Parents; was ſent to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> School, where he was under the Tuition of the Learned <hi>Thomas Bilſon,</hi> then School-Maſter there, and afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his Youth he was as bad as his Neighbours, yet not behind in Learning; was one of the chief <hi>Praepoſitors</hi> of the School; in which place he began to be a young Conſpirator, having framed a cruel Plot to fall upon the School-Maſter, and cut off his right hand. To which might be added his filthy <hi>Sodomy,</hi> with which he baſely abuſed five or <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Rob. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> (Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury)</hi> Antilog. in Epiſt. ad Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem.</note> ſix of the handſomeſt Scholars. And perceiving that theſe his Crimes would hinder his promotion to <hi>New-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> (from which School that Noble Foundation is ſupplied) he went to <hi>London,</hi> and obtained to be Corrector of the <hi>Common-Law</hi> Preſs, under Mr. <hi>Tottle</hi> the Printer.</p>
                     <p>Here he ſtaid not long, going to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he turn'd Jeſuit 1575. In this having employed himſelf ſome years, he return'd to <hi>England</hi> 1586, where he was very active againſt his Queen and Countrey, as in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, and other ſuch like Conſpiracies; and the better to ſecure himſelf, alter'd his Name as opportunity ſerved, ſometimes lurking under theſe ſeveral Names:

                     <p>Very zealous he was in hindring the coming of King <hi>James</hi> to the <hi>Ehgliſh</hi> Crown; and his Example was a great encouragement to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> he being the Provincial or Head of the Jeſuits in <hi>England.</hi> The better to prevent King <hi>James</hi> his Succeſſion, he had two <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Breves</hi> lying by him from the Pope, to publiſh as occaſion ſerved. And for a farther aſſiſtance, he ſent <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> 1601; with whom went alſo <hi>Greenwell,</hi> alias <hi>Teſmond</hi> the Jeſuit. Theſe, according to their Inſtructions, reſort to Father <hi>Creſwell,</hi> the Legier Jeſuit there, who conducted them to <hi>Don Pedro Franceſe,</hi> Secretary of State; and alſo to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> the chief Favourite; where they deſire, that a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army might preſently be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and they ſhould not want aid from the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in that Iſland. The Requeſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, the King promiſing to employ in it 100000 Crowns; wiſhing them in the mean time to give him notice of the Queen's death whenit ſhould happen.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Deſigns are carrying on, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dyed, and King <hi>James</hi> ſucceeded in the Throne, who granted a general and full pardon for all former Treaſons, to all who would take them out under

                     <p>He, <hi>Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Treſham,</hi> had a little before employed <hi>Chriſtopher Wright</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> to give advertiſement of the Queen's death, and to continue their former Negotiation with <hi>Winter.</hi> But now perceiving the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King cold in the buſineſs [he well conſidering the peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of King <hi>James,</hi> how firmly he was ſetled in the Throne, how often he had undertaken againſt <hi>England,</hi> but without ſucceſs; and now how his Treaſures were much exhauſted] <hi>Catesby</hi> therefore thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like ſome luſty Plot at home; and at laſt this Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is concluded on, which if it took effect, might raiſe ſuch Troubles and Garboils in <hi>England,</hi> that amongſt the ſeveral Intereſts, the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> (who would ſtick together) might play their own Games well, and by aſſiſtance from beyond Seas, ſecure their Cauſe, if not command the Crown.</p>
                     <p>In this, one ſcruple ſeem'd to ſtick by <hi>Catesby;</hi> for conſidering that at this general blowing up, ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> could not be kept from that ſlaughter; it being impoſſible to keep all they wiſh'd well to, from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Parliament-Houſe, without probability of a diſcovery. Upon this doubt, <hi>Catesby</hi> repaireth to <hi>Garnet,</hi> propounds unto him the caſe, asking, Whether for the good and promotion of the Catholique Cauſe againſt Hereticks (the neceſſity of time, and occaſion ſo requiring it) it be lawful or no amongſt many <hi>Nocents</hi> to deſtroy and take away ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents</hi> alſo?</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwers affirmatively; declaring, That if the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were greater to the Catholick part, by taking away ſome <hi>Innocents</hi> together with many <hi>Nocents,</hi> then doubtleſs it ſhould be lawful to kill and deſtroy them all; as we muſt not forbear the ſtorming of a Town, though ſome Friends be in it, who with the Enemy might be ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Now they are oſ opinion, That the Deſign is ſo ſecret, that there is no probability of its diſcovery; yet <hi>Garnet</hi> ſeem'd to wiſh, that the Pope's Conſent were had; but <hi>Catesby</hi> is of opinion, that the will of the Pope is ſufficiently manifeſt by his former <hi>Bulls</hi> poſitively againſt King <hi>James</hi> his Government or Rule.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>May</hi> 1605, fell out certain Broils in <hi>Wales</hi> by the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>June</hi> doth <hi>Greenwell</hi> the Jeſuit conſult at large with <hi>Garnet</hi> about the Treaſon; but this, as he pleaded, was under the diſguiſe of <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Now alſo was held a great Conſultation or Conference between <hi>Garnet, Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Treſham,</hi> concerning the ſtrength of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that they might inform the Pope of it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Auguſt, Garnet</hi> ſent Sir <hi>Edmund Baynam</hi> to the Pope (whom he <note n="*" place="margin">

But of this I make no great matter, ſeeing he prayed but according to his Church, and may carry a good, as well as a bad ſenſe; yet beſides this, he exhorted them to, and pray'd for a good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Others of them were taught thus to pray for the downfall of Hereſie, and the proſperity of their Deſigns, alluding to the working in the <hi>Myne,</hi> and the <hi>blowing</hi> up of the Houſe:
<q>
                           <p>Proſper, Lord, their pains that labour in thy Cauſe day and night; Let Hereſie vaniſh like ſmoak: Let the memory of it periſh with a Crack, like the ruin and fall of a broken Houſe.</p>

                     <p>On the ſixth of <hi>November,</hi> early in the morning, <hi>Catesby</hi> and his Confederates being met together, and perceiving all diſcovered, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make the beſt of a bad Market, ſent a Letter to <hi>Garnet,</hi> (then ready at <hi>Coulton</hi> near unto them) earneſtly entreating his help and aſſiſtance for the riſing of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the perſwading as many as he could into Arms. <hi>Greenwell</hi> the Jeſuit was with him; and ſo valiant for the Cauſe, that he poſted down into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to ſtir up as many as he could. But <hi>Garnet</hi> ſeeing all diſcovered, his heart now fail'd him, and ſo conſults his own ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>But a little after, <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Oldcorn</hi> the Jeſuit, were apprehended in Mr. <hi>Abington</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Henlip</hi> in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> being immured and cloſed up in a ſtack of Chimneys: the way or paſſage into the Cave or Vault where they lay, was an upper Room, by taking up the half-pace before the Hearth, whoſe wooden border was made like a Trap-door, to pluck up and down, and then the Bricks were laid in their Courſes and Order again.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe who have undertaken the juſtification of this <hi>Garnet,</hi> have thought to arm themſelves, and ſecure him with the power and virtue of theſe following Arguments:</p>

                        <item>1. His Denials.</item>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>As for his <hi>Denials,</hi> they are ſo far from quitting him from the crime, that they rather render him the greater Malefactor, if profeſt Lyes and Perjury can advance a man's guilt. 'Tis true, he was bold to a wonder, in proteſting and calling Heaven and Earth to witneſs his Innocency; but at laſt when he ſaw ſuch exact Proof and Teſtimony againſt him, he confeſt his <hi>Diſſimulation;</hi> pleading, That he thought they could not have produced ſuch clear proofs againſt him.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuits being not a little offended that he ſhould any way confeſs himſelf guilty, which with ſome might be a blot both to himſelf, and their Order; <hi>Garnet,</hi> to vindicate himſelf to them, and to ſhew the folly of denying any longer, thus writes to them—
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:109877:354"/> 
                        <hi>—What ſhould I do? Firſt, all the reſt of the Confederates have accuſed me. Secondly,</hi> Catesby <hi>always made uſe of my Authority amongſt them, whereby moſt of them were perſwaded to have a good opinion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; ſo that all knew I was in it. Thirdly, Two (ſet on purpoſe) heard me diſcourſe the whole buſineſs with</hi> Oldcorn <hi>and to tell him how I thought to anſwer to all Objections. Fourthly, My Letters writ with the Juyce of Oranges to</hi>

                        <hi>Mrs.</hi> Ann, <hi>are (I know not how) faln into their hands, whereby I plainly enough diſcovered my knowledg of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all his ſtrong denials at firſt, this is enough to prove him guilty: <note place="margin">Tort. Torti, pag. 286.</note> And beſides, if he were not ſo, Why did he himſelf confeſs—<hi>That he had often vowed, both by words and writing, to the Lay-Conſpirators, That he would never diſcover or betray any of them?</hi> To this might be added, how he did acknowledg his offence, wiſhing it were <hi>in his power to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do that which was done; and that if the whole world were his, he would willingly give it to quit himſelf from the guilt of Treaſon, which now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Conſcience.</hi> He alſo writ to his Favourite, Mrs. <hi>Vaux,</hi> his ſorrow that he could not dye for Religion, but for Treaſon. And many more Inſtances might be collected out of his Tryal; but this is enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie an honeſt man.</p>
                     <p>Yet he was very willing and earneſt to vindicate and clear himſelf from this Treaſon; in which he made a great deal of work with the Trick of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> of which he was a cunning and exquiſite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and as confident as ever man was: for this, one inſtance or two may ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Being asked, Whether he had any diſcourſe with the Jeſuit <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> ſince his Impriſonment? <hi>Garnet</hi> ſwearing upon his <hi>Salvation,</hi> with <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Iſ.

                        </note> many other horrid Imprecations, denied again and again that he had any diſcourſe. Which being preſently proved againſt him, he confeſt it, begg'd pardon, affirming that his former Denial was by virtue of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time being asked, Whether he did well to ſwear upon the <hi>Holy Evangeliſt,</hi> That he had neither writ or ſent to the Jeſuit <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> which he knew to be falſe? He replied, That he ſware ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough, becauſe then he did not think that his Letters were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and ſo they could not have diſproved him.</p>
                     <p>A little before the Queen's death, when they were buſie in their Plots to keep out King <hi>James;</hi> in vindication of this Jugling Faculty, there was compoſed a little Book entituled,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And yet, rather than fail in his Sanctity, they can invent a pretty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to witneſs it: As, how one <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> earneſtly deſiring to be a Spectator of <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Martyrdom, not doubting but that God would ſhew ſome Miracle or other to demonſtrate he Father's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: Accordingly he went to the place of Execution (Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard) ſetled himſelf as conveniently as he could, ſtaid till all was done, got nothing but an ear of <hi>Corn</hi> (tainted with a little of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s blood) belonging to the Straw of the Hurdle or Scaffold: This he carrieth with him as an holy Relique; and after ſome time <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Face miraculouſly appeareth as painted on it, a Crown on his Head, and a Starr and a Croſs on the Forehead, with a Cherubim hanging over his Chin, and Beams about all.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the truth of the ſtory was thus: <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> a zealous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi> and affected to the Jeſuits, might get a piece of a Straw taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Blood; a <hi>Straw,</hi> or Ear of Corn, with ſome Blood on it, he carrieth to the Wife of <hi>Hugh Griffith,</hi> a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and <hi>Romaniſt</hi> by Profeſſion. This ſhe puts into a Cryſtal Caſe, and we need not doubt but that it was look'd upon with a great deal of Devotion, but as yet nothing of a Face could be ſeen by any eye.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, about the Eighteenth day of <hi>September,</hi> 1606, <hi>(viz.</hi> above ſix Months after <hi>Garnet</hi> was executed) ſome of the zealous <hi>Romaniſts</hi> looking upon it, ſaw that which they call'd the Face of a man. Thus is a Miracle found out, and <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> haſtes beyond Seas to the Jeſuits at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> telling them what a pretty wonder he had diſcovered for the honour of their Society, into which he was preſently enter'd.</p>
                     <pb n="705" facs="tcp:109877:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>But here we may obſerve, that they confeſs, that <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> came from the ſaid St. <hi>Omers</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> a little before <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Execution; and it may be ſent upon the cheat. Again, how cometh the Wonder to be above Four Months, or about Nineteen Weeks in doing? Or, Might it not be done by Art, ſince <hi>Francis Bowen</hi> (to whom it was ſhewn by <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Friend, Mrs. <hi>Ann Vaux)</hi> who had ſome skill in Painting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, an Artiſt might make one neater; and preſently upon the place, for a trial, one of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Gentlemen (whoſe Profeſſion was not Painting) drew one, which <hi>Bowen</hi> confeſt was like that of the Straw, but a little better proportion'd; and Practiſe daily teacheth us, that Faces may be done in a leſs Compaſs.</p>
                     <p>As for the thing it ſelf, 'twas only a few Lines drawn like a Face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the outward Husk of a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Wheat;</hi> but without any ſuch Beams or Glories about it, as the Jeſuits would make ſimple people believe; nor any more like <hi>Garnet</hi> (as <hi>Hugh Griffith</hi> the Taylor himſelf confeſt) than any other man that had a Beard.</p>

                     <p>And to this might be added another Miracle: for though at firſt there was but one <hi>Straw</hi> and Face, yet it ſeemeth that they had afterwards an ambition to multiply them; and, for ought that I know, would make every <hi>Straw</hi> at his Execution, bear his Picture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>

                     <hi>This Oath now grounded upon ſo great and juſt occaſion, ſet forth in ſo reaſonable Terms, and ordain'd only for making of a true</hi> diſtinction <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Papiſts <hi>of</hi> Quiet diſpoſition, <hi>and in all other things</hi> good Subjects; <hi>and ſuch other</hi> Papiſts <hi>as in their hearts maintained the like violent</hi> bloody Maximes <hi>that the</hi> Powder-Traytors <hi>did.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Which godly and wiſe intent, God did bleſs with ſucceſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: For many of my Subjects that were <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, as well Prieſts as Layicks, <hi>did freely take the ſame Oath;</hi> whereby they gave me occaſion to think the better of their fidelity; and likewiſe freed themſelves of that heavy <hi>ſlander,</hi> that although they were fellow-Profeſſors of one Religion with the <hi>Powder-Traytors,</hi> yet were not joined with them in Treaſonable Courſes againſt their Soveraign.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereby all quietly-minded <hi>Papiſts</hi> were put out of deſpair; and I gave a good proof that I intended no Perſecution againſt them for Conſcience Cauſe, but only deſired to be ſecured of them for Civil Obedience, which for Conſcience Cauſe they were bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But the Devil could not have deviſed a more malicious trick for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetrupting this ſo Calm and Clement a courſe, than fell out by the ſending hither, and publiſhing a <hi>Breve</hi> of the <hi>Popes,</hi> countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all them of his Profeſſion to take this <hi>Oath;</hi> thereby ſowing new ſeeds of Jealouſie between me and my Popiſh Subjects, by ſtirring them up to diſobey that Lawful Commandment of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, which was ordain'd to be taken of them as a pledg of their fidelity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty here alludes to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. who upon the coming out of this Oath, ſends out a <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Breve</hi> againſt it, forbidding any of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to take the ſaid Oath. The manner of their procuring, and how the <hi>Engliſh-Romaniſts</hi> in this juncture behaved themſelves, take as followeth:</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was the <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament publiſhed, but there <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Rog. Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi>'s Theological Diſputation, Epiſt.

Priest of</hi> England.</note> 
                     <hi>George Blackwell</hi> their <hi>Arch-Prieſt,</hi> what they and their Friends ought to do in this caſe. At laſt <hi>Blackwell</hi> did conclude, that this Oath (according to the plain and common underſtanding of the words) might with a ſafe Conſcience be taken by the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and with him agreed a greater part of the Prieſts, who went then to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to aſſiſt at this Conſultation.</p>
                  <p>But this Compliance was oppoſed by certain <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ſome other Prieſts, from whence aroſe all the ſtir and controverſie which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Diviſions amongſt them, concerning the taking of this Oath: Nor is the Diſpute yet ended.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Faction reſolving not to be bafled, would carry the buſineſs with a high hand; to which purpoſe they threatned to procure a <hi>Breve</hi> from the Pope to hinder the taking of the ſaid Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blackwell</hi> and his party fearing the worſt, with all haſte diſpatched a Letter to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Fitzherbert,</hi> an Engliſh Prieſt then flouriſhing in <hi>Rome;</hi> fully relating to him how the caſe ſtood amongſt them, earneſtly deſiring him to deal effectually with ſome Cardinals, that the Pope might be perſwaded not to ſend over any <hi>Breves</hi> againſt the taking of the ſaid Oath, which would but encreaſe their Trouble, and render the Diviſions wider.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were too quick and powerful for the other Prieſts; for their Letter came too late, and to no purpoſe; it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

                     <hi>of the Learned'ſt Divines that could be choſen to give their judgment of it (i. e.</hi> the Oath): <hi>Their Reaſons are many; but all reduced to this, That the Pope's Authority in chaſtiſing Princes upon a juſt Cauſe, is</hi> de fide, <hi>and conſequently cannot be denied when it is call'd into controverſie, without</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of our Faith; <hi>nor that the Pope or any other Authority can diſpence in this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For if the Queſtion were</hi> de facto, <hi>and not</hi> de jure, <hi>to wit, Whether the</hi> Pope <hi>might</hi> juſtly <hi>in this or that occaſion Excommunicate or</hi> Depoſe <hi>this or that Prince upon theſe or theſe cauſes; or whether precedent</hi> Popes <hi>have done</hi> well <hi>therein, or no? Then might ſome of theſe Reaſons, which you ſay your Friends do alledg, be admitted into Conſideration; to wit, Whether it could be</hi> in aedificationem, <hi>or</hi> deſtructionem, <hi>do hurt or good, be profitable or improfitable? or, Whether the Cauſes be ſufficient or no? for without cauſe none holdeth that the</hi> Pope <hi>may</hi> depoſe: <hi>Or, Whether the due form of Admonition, touched in your Letters, were obſerved? But foraſmuch as the Queſtion is</hi> de Poteſtate <hi>of the See-Apoſtolick Power, What it may do upon any Cauſe, or againſt any Catholick Prince whatſoever; theſe Conſiderations of temporal hurt cannot enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides theſe, I have conferred the matter with Cardinal</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and ſundry others of great Learning and Conſcience; and all are of one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this caſe, That the form of the</hi> Oath, <hi>as it lieth, is</hi> Heretical, <hi>and no way may be admitted by him that will not deny the</hi> Catholick Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I had occaſion twice to ſpeak with his</hi> Holineſs; <hi>the firſt, in company of Mr.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Kinſmanto the former <hi>Nic. Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>
                     </note> Thomas Fitzherbert, <hi>where we propoſed certain manners of Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſuggeſted by Friends,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereto his Holineſs anſwered, That as for any Actual uſing Cenſures againſt his Majeſty, he meant not, but rather all Courteſie. But as for the Authority of the See-Apoſtolick</hi> (to wit, uſing of Cenſures) <hi>he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and would rather loſe his Head, than yeeld one jot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond; He being informed that ſome</hi> Prieſts <hi>did ſeem to incline to the taking of the</hi> Oath. <hi>He anſwered,</hi> He could not hold them for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how the Plot was carried, and how zealous the Pope and his Aſſiſtants were againſt the taking of this Oath, as if it were enough to overthrow their whole Religion: Though King <hi>James</hi> did aſſure them and the World, That no deciſion of any one point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was intended in this Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as for the Catholick Faith, Can there be one word found</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Apol. for the Oath, pag. 63</note> 
                     <hi>in all that Oath, tending or ſounding to matter of Religion? Doth he that takoth it, promiſe there to believe or not to believe any Article of Religion? Or doth he ſo much as name a true or a falſe Church there? And as for St.</hi> Peter's Primacy, <hi>I know no</hi> Apoſtle's Name <hi>that is therein named, except the Name of</hi> JAMES, <hi>it being my Chriſtian Name—Neither is there any mention at all made therein, either</hi> diſertis verbis, <hi>or by any

                  </p>
                  <p>But however, as if this Oath quite overthrew the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and rendred the Pope no more powerful than his Predeceſſors were in the firſt Three hundred years, out comes a <hi>Breve</hi> from his Holineſs, right or wrong, expreſly commanding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not to take the ſaid Oath upon any means whatever. Part of which, take as followeth.</p>

                              <p>It is reported unto us, That there are found certain amongſt you, <hi>(who)</hi> when as we have ſufficiently declared by our Letters, dated the laſt year, on the xxij of <hi>September,</hi> in the form of a <hi>Breve,</hi> that ye cannot with ſafe Conſcience take the Oath which was then required of you; and when as we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraitly commanded you, that by no means you ſhould take it.</p>
                              <p>Yet there are ſome (I ſay) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who dare now affirm, that ſuch Letters concerning the forbidding of the Oath, were not written of our own accord, or of our own proper will, but rather for the reſpect, and at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other men: and for that cauſe the ſame men go about to perſwade you, that our Commands in the ſaid Letters are not to be regarded.</p>
                              <p>Truly this News did trouble us; and that ſo much the more, becauſe having had experience of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (moſt dearly beloved Sons), who to the end you might obey this Holy See, have godlily and valiantly contemned your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Wealth, Honour, Liberty, yea and Life it ſelf: We ſhould never have ſuſpected that the truth of our <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Letters could once be call'd into queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, that by this pretence you might exempt your ſelves from our Commandments.</p>
                              <p>But we do perceive herein the ſubtilty and craft of the Enemy of man's ſalvation; and we do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this your backwardneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, than to your own will.</p>
                              <p>And for this cauſe we have thought good to write the ſecond time unto you, and to ſignifie unto you again, that our Apoſtolical

                              <p>And this is our meer, pure and perfect will, who being always careful of your ſalvation, do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mind thoſe things which are moſt profitable unto you.</p>

                  <p>Some Months after the publiſhing of the firſt <hi>Breve,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Blackwell</hi> [conſtituted the <hi>Arch-Prieſt</hi> 1598, by <hi>Henry</hi> Cardinal <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> call'd <hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation by the Appointment of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII.] was ſeiz'd on, examined and impriſoned, and the Oath offer'd him, which he freely took.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> upon notice of this, writes a long Letter to <hi>Blackwell,</hi> telling him how <hi>joyous the news</hi> (of the Impriſonment) <hi>ſeem'd</hi> to him, becauſe (forſooth) <hi>now you draw near unto the glory of</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; <hi>than the which, there cannot be a gift of God more happy;</hi> and therefore bids him for the comfort of the Church, be valiant and ſtout. 'Tis eaſie giving advice afar off; but the Cardinal did not care to put himſelf into the danger of Hereticks, ever ſince he aſſiſted the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>League</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>But there is one thing that clouds all this Rejoycing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> ſhould take the Oath: This troubles the Cardinal, who tells the
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:109877:364"/> 
                     <hi>Arch-Prieſt,</hi> That <hi>the</hi> Oath <hi>is ſo craftily compoſed, that no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Treaſon againſt the King, and make profeſſion of his Civil ſubjection, but he muſt be conſtrained</hi> perfidiouſly <hi>to</hi> deny <hi>the</hi> Primacy <hi>of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick See. But the Servants of Chriſt, and eſpecially the</hi> Chief Prieſts <hi>of the Lord, ought to be ſo far from taking an unlawful Oath, where they may endamage the Faith, that they ought to beware that they give not the leaſt ſuſpition of Diſſimulation that they have taken it—For if you will diligently weigh the whole matter with your ſelf, truly you ſhall ſee it is no ſmall matter that is called in queſtion by this</hi> Oath, <hi>but one of the</hi> principal Heads <hi>of our</hi> Faith, <hi>and</hi> Foundations <hi>of Catholique Religion.</hi> And for proof of this, he produceth little ſcraps out of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and ſuch like Inſtances, nothing at all God wot to the Buſineſs in hand, as <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelf in his Anſwer to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>The Pope conſidering Father <hi>Blackwell</hi>'s Humour, and it may be his Confinement, appointed (1608) Mr. <hi>George Birket</hi> to be <hi>Arch-Prieſt,</hi> and ſent him a <hi>Breve</hi> to forbid the taking of the Oath, and to deprive all Prieſts of their Faculties that ſhould take it. Part of which, take as followeth.</p>

                           <hi>WHereas I have always deſired to live without Moleſting or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending others, it cannot be but a wonderful Corſive, Sorrow and Grief unto me, that againſt mine own inclination I am forced (as you have ſeen by the</hi> Breve <hi>it ſelf) to preſcribe a certain time for ſuch as do find themſelves to have been contrary to the points which are touched in the ſaid</hi> Breve, <hi>concerning the</hi> Oath, <hi>and going to</hi> Church, <hi>that they may thereby return and conform themſelves to the Doctrine declared by his</hi> Holineſs, <hi>both in this and the other former</hi> Breves.</p>

                           <hi>And therefore now by this Preſent do give notice unto you all, That the time which I prefix and preſcribe for that purpoſe, is the ſpace of two Months next enſuing after the knowledg of this my</hi> Admonition. <hi>Within which time, ſuch as ſhall forbear to take or allow any more the</hi> Oath, <hi>or going to</hi> Church, <hi>I ſhall moſt willingly accept their doing therein.</hi>

                  <p>Now were Pens employed on both ſides, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cuffing one another bravely about the Oath; Voluminous <hi>Coquaeus</hi> comes railing from <hi>France</hi> againſt it; <hi>Getſer</hi> oppoſeth it in <hi>Germany; Andraeus Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonioannes</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> declares it Abominable; In <hi>Italy,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is very buſie againſt it; ſometimes under his own, other times masked under falſe Names, as <hi>Tortus,</hi> and ſome think <hi>Schulckenius</hi> was one and the ſame perſon with the Cardinal.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> now flouriſh'd <hi>Franciſcus Suarez;</hi> he alſo, by order from
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:109877:365"/> the Pope and <hi>Conclave,</hi> is commanded to undertake it; which he doth: But the good old man thought he was hardly dealt withall by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, to whom having ſent his Book for Approbation, they alter'd <note place="margin">

                  <p>But above all the oppoſers of this Oath, none like Father <hi>Parſons;</hi> who to have the better pretence of Reviling, will father King <hi>James</hi> his Apology upon <hi>Thomas Montague,</hi> and (through that ſuppoſed Name) beſpatter his Majeſty.

                     <hi>without peril of everlaſting Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt, <hi>Parſons</hi> coming to argue againſt it, is driven to the Fanatical Argument, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and thus boldly aſſerts it. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 38. §. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>neither Breathing, nor the uſe of common Air, is more due unto them [i. e.</hi> good Subjects] <hi>or common to all, than ought to be</hi> Liberty of Conſcience <hi>to Chriſtian men whereby each one liveth to God and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and without which he ſtrugleth with the torment of a continual lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring death.</hi> And then a little after, thus boaſts—<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Id</hi> pag. 51. §. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Let them ſhew but one only Authority Sentence. Example, or Teſtimony out of any of theſe three kind of Witneſſes, Scriptures, Fathers, or Councils, that we muſt obey Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt our Conſcience or Religion, and I will grant he ſaith ſomewhat to the purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus will they have all their Religion or Faith to hang upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or not taking of this Oath. But in this zeal for liberty he meets with a Rub, and that is this: Why then do the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> force <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> by their <hi>Inquiſitions</hi> to abjure their Opinions; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Id.</hi> pag. 23. §. 36.</note> puniſh them with Death, or as the Crime requireth?</p>
                  <p>To this Objection, <hi>Parſons</hi> thinks he ſaith enough, by telling you, that the caſe is not the ſame; becauſe (forſooth) the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath <hi>jus acquiſitum,</hi> ancient right over Hereticks; but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> hath no ſuch thing upon Catholicks. As Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Aſſertion as could be imagined, ſeeing according to his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the thing in hand, A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King can have no right over <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and ſo <hi>Proteſtaniſm</hi> muſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deprive Kings, and render them uncapable of Dominion, where the people are of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion; ſo that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was not, nor could be King of <hi>France</hi> till he was reconciled to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, all of them who write againſt the Oath, ground all their Exceptions upon this, That they think it takes away the Pope's power of depriving Kings, and abſolving Subjects from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſo that we may ſee what it is that pincheth them, and how much they look upon Loyalty and true Obedience to be an Enemy to their Intereſt and Church.</p>
                  <p>But to render this Oath more odious and terrible, they amaze the ſimple people with ſtrange ſtories of God's Judgments againſt the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it; and this, with the Vulgar, they make one of their beſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>They alledg, That the Captain of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Father <hi>Blackwell,</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Rog. Widdrington</hi>'s Theolog. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſput. cap. 10. Sect. 4.</note> ſuddenly: To which the other Party reply, That 'tis granted, that <hi>Blackwell</hi> on Saturday in the afternoon [<hi>viz.</hi> 25 of <hi>January,</hi> 1612] fell into a ſwoun (being well before), upon which he was had
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:109877:365" rendition="simple:additions"/> to bed, whither ſome Prieſts came to him; to whom he affirmed, he had done nothing contrary to his Conſcience in taking the ſaid Oath, and that it was a lawful Oath; and ſo dyed a little after; but his death was five years after he had taken the Oath.</p>
                  <p>That if ſudden-deaths be Arguments, they could retort, and tell them of ſome Prieſts, Enemies of the Oath, who dyed by the ſame Judgments; as of one in the North, who (otherwiſe very healthy) was ſo ſuddenly ſtrucken with a deadly Diſeaſe, that he dyed within ſixteen hours. Of another that fell down a pair of Stairs, whereby he was ſo bruiſed, that he lived not long after. Of a third, who leaping haſtily over an Hedg, fell into a pit on the other ſide of the Hedg, and ſo was caſt away. To all theſe might be added, that one of the greateſt Champions the <hi>Oath</hi> had, was Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> (or <hi>Rowland) Preſton,</hi> a learned <hi>Benedictan Monk,</hi> who lived many a fair year after his taking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the ſaid Oath; though the Pope and his Party might have wiſh'd that he had dyed ſooner, or writ leſs. Yet he diſguiſed his Writings under the Name of <hi>Roger Widdrington</hi> [who indeed was another <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi> living in the North]; under which Name he oppoſed <hi>Suarez,</hi> baffled <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> confuted <hi>Gretzer, Becanus,</hi> and the reſt of their Party; whereupon ſome began to call it <hi>Widdrington's Doctrine,</hi> i. e. to defend the lawfulneſs of the Oath of Allegiance. The Jeſuits had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral deſigns againſt him; once they plotted to ſeize upon him in a Boat upon the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and ſo to hurry him beyond Seas, where they would have claw'd him for his defending <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance:</hi> but he ſuſpected that the beyond-ſea Air would haſten his death; therefore for ſome years he ſecured himſelf in the <hi>Clink,</hi> where he lived with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, followed his Studies, and had an excellent Library of his own.</p>
                  <p>Again the other Party object, That Mr. <hi>Jackson</hi> who took the Oath, dyed of the Plague. But this is nothing to the unwarrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Oath, unleſs we will argue, that it was unlawful to regain the <hi>Holy-land</hi> from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> becauſe S. <hi>Lewis</hi> ix, King of <hi>France,</hi> and one that is Canonized, is ſaid to dye of the Plague in that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that we muſt not read <hi>Sanders</hi> his Book <hi>de Schiſmate,</hi> becauſe <hi>Edward Riſhton,</hi> a rebellious ungrateful Prieſt, publiſhed it, and made Continuations to it, and dyed of the Plague in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, the <hi>Anti-Loyaliſts</hi> flye ſo low, that rather than have nothing to ſay, they would object as a fault the living or breathing at a Biſhops Houſe; and all this a-do, becauſe Mr. <hi>William Warmington</hi> lived in the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Houſe; whereas the Objection was occaſioned by their own uncharitableneſs: For <hi>Warmington</hi> having taken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf as a Champion of the Oath, his own <hi>Roman</hi> Friends and Kindred became his Enemies, withdrawing from him all the Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they uſed to allow him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warmington</hi> put to this ſtreſs of Livelihood only for his Loyalty and Obedience, petitions the King for ſome Allowance. The King graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accepts it, commends him to Dr. <hi>Bilſon</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> with order to take him to himſelf to his own Houſe, there to provide for him. The Biſhop obeys, <hi>Warmington</hi> lives with him, wants nothing, hath liberty at pleaſure, and freedom of his Religion. And is not this a notable Argument to prove the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> unlawful.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe ſhould fail, they can flye to their old trick of Miracles, and bring Heaven it ſelf to confute the Oath; and this they doubt not but will work much with the honeſt <hi>Romaniſt.</hi> One of their Stories take as followeth.</p>
                  <pb n="724" facs="tcp:109877:366"/>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Newton</hi> of <hi>Pickworth</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, meeting at <hi>Standford</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Edward Sutton</hi> of <hi>Kellam</hi> in <hi>Noting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire,</hi> a diſorderly pretended <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> were there apprehended, and committed to the Town-Hall; at laſt were carried to <hi>Thomas Cecyl</hi> Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who proffer'd them the Oath of Allegiance; <hi>Sutton</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome excuſes took it, but <hi>Newton</hi> deſired time to conſider of it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, for want of Bail, and at the Conſtables deſire, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Town-Hall.</p>
                  <p>Here theſe two diſcourſed about the Oath; <hi>Newton</hi> aſſuring to his Companion its unlawfulneſs. To bed they go together. About midnight <note place="margin">September 4. 1612.</note> 
                     <hi>Sutton</hi> cryeth out, That he was damned only for taking the Oath, and declareth <hi>Newton</hi> happy for refuſing it. <hi>Newton</hi> bids him make the ſign of the Croſs; <hi>Sutton</hi> doth ſo; then creeps down into the bed, ſaying, he durſt not look up to behold the Viſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Newton</hi> looks up, ſees the Room full of light and brightneſs, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Trinity repreſented to him; then there appears the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in a ſhining white Robe, with an infinite company of Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, holding a Crown over her head, ſinging in honour of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Alleluia, Gloria in Excelſis Deo.</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Newton</hi> thought that the Virgin thus ſpake to him—<hi>Behold, ſee and believe my</hi> Aſſumption <hi>in Body. Take not the Oath, but rather endure all Torments; for I will be with thee, and aſſiſt thee in all, and will ſtrengthen and preſerve thee from all pains and torments, with ſuch Conſolations as thou now feeleſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Viſion continued about half an hour; and a little before they vaniſhed, there appeared alſo a multitude of Saints and Martyrs, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up (as it were) Incenſe unto Almighty God, and ſaying to him—<hi>Double thy Devotion unto Saints; for nothing is more acceptable unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi> Thus was <hi>Newton</hi> confirmed in two points, which before (as he ſaid) he ſomewhat doubted of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Virgins Aſſumption, and Prayers to Saints.</p>
                  <p>The Viſion ended, <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Sutton</hi> roar out as loud as they could, <hi>Alleluia, Gloria,</hi> &amp;c. and thus they continued balling for three or four hours, <hi>Sutton</hi> ſaying, that now he had learned how to pray.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, <hi>Sutton</hi> turns ſtark mad, and becomes diſtracted. The Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi> adminiſters the Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Newton,</hi> who for all the contrary Commands in the Viſion, took it, and ſo was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And this is the ſum of the pretty Tale which Father <hi>Preſton,</hi> an honeſt <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> thinks ought to be aſcribed either <note n="*" place="margin">Theolog. Diſput. cap. 10. Sect. 5. § 23.</note> 
                     <hi>to the vehement I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of a troubled Brain, or elſe to be accounted a meer Illuſion of the Devil.</hi> And ſo I leave it to the diſcretion of the Reader, with liberty to approve or diſprove theſe doughty Arguments againſt the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
                  <p>But leſt theſe Illuſions, Inventions, and idle Stories, ſhould not do the good or miſchief intended, the Pope muſt ever now and anon hurry over his <hi>Bulls</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to rowſe up the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and put them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence againſt the ſaid Oath.</p>
                  <p>In King <hi>James</hi> his time, there were ſeveral ſuch Papers; nor were they diſcontinued in King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. his days. In the beginning of whoſe Reign Pope <hi>
